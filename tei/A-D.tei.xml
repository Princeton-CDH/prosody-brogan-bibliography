               <bibl> Alden, R[aymond] M[acdonald]. English Verse: Specimens Illustrating Its
                  Principles and History. New York: Henry Holt, 1903; 2nd ed. 1929; rpt New York:
                  AMS Press, 1970. 441 pp. Rev: in The Nation 77 (1903): 118–20; by Omond in The
                  Academy 76 (1909): 976–77; in Sewanee Review 11 (1903): 383–84. </bibl>
               <note> To the teaching critic, English Verse is probably more useful as a compendium
                  of examples of verseforms than as a history or theory of English versification,
                  even though the book intends to offer both these latter. Chapter One of Part One
                  and Part Three set forth Alden's principles, which are that accent at equal
                  time-intervals is the basis of English meter, that three degrees of accent (pri-
                  mary, secondary, and weak) from three causes (lexical, syntactic, and metrical)
                  are distinguishable, that the metrical pause is allowable, that verse is only
                  analo- gous to music, that English syllables do have rudimentary and entirely
                  relative quantity, that the concept of the metrical foot is worth preserving so
                  long as it is understood as representing "the time-interval between the regularly
                  recur- ring accents of the normal metre," and that in scansion the secondary
                  accent if marked only complicates unduly the traditional notation, so that only
                  the bi- nary levels of stressed and unstressed are to be noted. Summarized on p.
                  405. As Omond observed, Alden does not pursue the temporal theory of meter as
                  aggressively as most, but his analyses do "depart considerably from mere
                  stresses." Alden's position lies somewhere between the ad hoc impressionism of
                  Saintsbury and the deductive interpretation of Omond; he seems most directly
                  indebted to Schipper (A9) and Mayor (E592). Chapter Two of Part One is reprinted
                  in abridged form as an Appendix to Gross (A23, pp. 235–64). Part Two is a history
                  of forms; Part Three, "The Time-Element in English Verse," reprints the substance
                  of an earlier article in MLN (E272). Part Four collects the views of thirteen
                  poets and critics on "The Place and Function of the Metrical Element in Poetry."

               <note> Though now somewhat out of date, this well-positioned book has not yet been
                  superseded. It does not aim to advance "an ideal prosody . . . any original
                  theories . . . or critical estimates," but simply to present a coherent view of
                  the technic of American poetry up to 1900, as seen in both the stylistic develop-
                  ment and the known theoretical views of eleven major American poets: Freneau,
                  Bryant, Poe, Emerson, Whittier, Longfellow, Holmes, Whitman, Lowell, Lanier, and
                  Dickinson. The Introduction has the considerable virtue of distinguishing terms
                  clearly and the lesser vice of allowing too many of them: Allen recognizes four
                  natural speech-stresses (primary, secondary, "weak secondary," and weak),
                  "metrical stresses" (apparently compromise scansions of the natural stressing of
                  the line against the abstract metrical pattern), and four regular metrical feet
                  (the common ones) but up to seven additional ones (tri- brachs, ionics, bacchics,
                  etc.). A short section also discusses the influence of British versification on
                  American, a subject which despite its obvious impor- tance has never yet been
                  thoroughly examined. Allen's study broke the neces- sary new ground, but after a
                  half century of extensive scholarship it should now be possible to reappraise the
                  whole subject of American versification-- both theory and praxis--in a much more
                  systematic and sophisticated way. See also Eaton (E25), Gillis (E35), and Fussel

               <note> The translation, which follows the original closely, is hereafter referred to
                  as Kaluza. During the writing of his book, Kaluza clearly felt the lingering
                  coolness of the long shadow cast by Schipper's monumental work (A9); he is at
                  pains, in the Preface and elsewhere, to justify his own study, claiming that "the
                  mass of detail in Schipper is confusing for the beginner, and his presentation of
                  Old and Middle English prosody needs correction in many important points." In
                  fact, however, Kaluza's own study is considerably more complicated in theory and
                  more scholarly in method than Schipper's, and it is decidedly not a book for
                  beginners. But no justification was needed: Kaluza has not given us a full- scale
                  history of English verse-tech-nique, as did Schipper, but rather a seem- ingly
                  indefatigable study of the various prosodic theories about verse—particu- larly
                  Old and Middle English verse--that had been advanced up to 1900 by the German
                  philologists. Indeed, Kaluza's title is misleading, since fully two-thirds of his
                  book treats English verse before 1500. But for this single purpose--a synoptic,
                  detailed account of the German theories of the Old Germanic and Old English
                  alliterative line--Kaluza is valuable, and in that value superior to any other
                  work yet written. After Kaluza we must go directly to the Germans. Kaluza's
                  principles are accentual: the thesis and arsis (he uses these terms in their
                  modern sense) make up the foot in syllable-counting verse, or the bar (takt,
                  measure) in alliterative stress-verse. Elucidating the course of the theories
                  about Old English verse, he discusses the "four-stress" (to the half-line) theory
                  of Lachmann and his followers and the competing "two-stress" theory of Wackernagel
                  et al., accounts that were eventually superseded by Sievers' "Five Types" system
                  (Sievers himself was of the two-stress school). Kaluza adheres to the doctrines of
                  the older four-stress school, and so a considerable portion of his long first
                  section on Old English is given over to a detailed criticism of the Sievers
                  theory, Kaluza substituting for it instead his own modified version (pp. 60–64) of
                  two Laws, six Types, and ninety "subspecies," but nevertheless la- boring to make
                  the whole system compatible with the authoritative Five Types typology. See
                  Kaluza's monograph (J139) in Part 2, Section 1, below. All the German philologists
                  were pretty well agreed that the oldest Indo- European meter had been well agreed
                  that the oldest Indo-European meter had been x / x / x / x / x / (later to be
                  called the iambic dimeter in classical Greek metrics), a meter which was divided
                  into four bars for purposes of dancing or singing. When he came to the Middle
                  English, French-derived meters of our verse, Kaluza had the candor and good sense
                  to acknowledge there the pres- ence of an entirely new form, with different rules
                  for construction and hence an entirely different texture and structure from that
                  of Old English verse--all merely by the addition of the simple rule of
                  syllable-counting. Appropriately, then, Kaluza views the Middle English
                  alliterative verses as derived not from the Old English form but from a mixed form
                  of the Latin septenary transmitted to the English by the Christian monks. On the
                  Modern period, Kaluza gives only a short synopsis of the nature of the modern
                  meters (in modern English it is easier than it formerly was to dispose the
                  stresses at rhythmically equal periods of time; the poet, then, must create
                  harmony out of the clash of word-stresses and metrical-accents; inver- sion and
                  hovering accent were developed to reduce this difficulty, as well as elision,
                  which will produce a correct metrical value for excess syllables (pp. 266–84),
                  then traces out in cameo the modern development of the various metrical and
                  stanzaic forms, especially blank verse. </note>

               <note> Prior to the present study, English Metrists offered the most succinct,
                  thorough, and accessible history of English metrical theory available. Given the
                  date of Omond's first two editions (A6 and A7), a comparison of his work with
                  Saintsbury (A8) is natural, even though the contrasts between the two could
                  scarcely be greater: Omond is a history of critical theorizing about verse-
                  structure, while Saintsbury is in fact a history of the poets' practice; Omond's
                  assumptions about the (temporal) nature of poetic meter are evident on every page
                  of his criticism, whereas Saintsbury repeatedly evades the explicit and takes
                  refuge in the ambiguous and unexamined; Omond believed that a quan- titative verse
                  could be written in English, whereas Saintsbury rejected the pos- sibility out of
                  hand while paradoxically insisting on the retention of its archaic terminology.
                  For the serious student of English verseform, however, Omond is the indispensable
                  book. English Metrists is not, however, so much a history as a bibliography; the
                  text of the book is actually little more than a discursive, amplified commentary
                  on the bibliographical lists at the end. So the work might more properly be
                  thought of as discursive bibliography (see Chapter Three, Earlier Bibliogra-
                  phies, below). As such, however, its value is in no wise diminished; for the
                  eighteenth and nineteenth centuries especially, Omond's research was meticu- lous.
                  And he regularly allows three to five pages for a discussion of a particu- larly
                  important writer, a practice I have much envied, being unable to follow it here. I
                  have included in the present work every full article or book which Omond cites,
                  but there remain, in English Metrists, many brief notices of passages of verses,
                  remarks, correspondence, and other references which I have not thought worthy of
                  pursuit. Scholars working on future, more specialized studies such as the
                  nineteenth century interest in hexameters will want to re- turn to these, as well
                  as to search out others which Omond himself mentions only in passing. The function
                  of the present book in relation to its predecessor, then, is twofold--extension,
                  and organization. The limitations of Omond's book, in other words, form the
                  greater part of the rationale for this one. To begin with, Omond's meticulous
                  bibliographic searches end not long after the turn of the century (1908 for
                  quantitative verse and, much less rigorously [Omond was ill], 1920 for accentual
                  verse). The great mass of newer work published since that time has wanted
                  collecting and reviewing, and so I have thought to bring Omond up to date.
                  Moreover, though his researches at the British Museum and the Bodleian were
                  prodigious, Omond frequently confesses himself unac- quainted to the same degree
                  with American scholarship, particularly periodical. He has not, for example,
                  searched the nineteenth-century American literary journals for articles on
                  versification as he did the British. But more impor- tantly, Omond's criteria for
                  inclusion now seem unacceptably narrow: he ad- mitted only (1) works on English
                  metrics (2) written in English, constraints which immediately barred him from the
                  whole field of German scholarship on English philology (especially Old English,
                  which Omond had little interest in) in the late nineteenth century, as well as
                  from the important treatises of Schip- per, Kaluza, Verrier, and others on English
                  metrics. My own criterion has been that a work be on English versification (a far
                  wider subject than merely metrics) regardless of its provenience or language of
                  discourse. A truly com- prehensive theory will require a truly comprehensive
                  search for information. Beyond the problem of scope, however, there is the problem
                  of organi- zation, and here Omond's book must be judged to have done little to
                  clear up the immense confusions in English metrical theory. The source lists of
                  English Metrists are divided into two parts, one a list of attempts to write (and
                  legiti- mize) quantitative meters in English, the other a survey of theories about
                  the ordinary accentual-syllabic tradition. This scheme is useful for chronological
                  reference, but not for the immediately essential purpose of keeping separate
                  problems separate. Omond makes no effort in his second list to sort out the
                  competing schools of theorists, a procedure which is immensely important for
                  readers who have little knowledge of the field and no idea of the quandaries which
                  await them. Too, the bibliographical lists are cumbersome visually, for
                  typographical reasons, and though the citation data is exceptionally accurate even
                  for very obscure works, the remarks added thereto are less informative than
                  evaluative. This latter difficulty, though, betokens a broader one, and a candid
                  review of English Metrists would have to weigh heavily the fact that the book is,
                  albeit modestly, a tendentious one. Omond firmly accepts the tem- poral nature of
                  English verse as the foundation of its meter. This principle and others are
                  evident, and they continually shade the chronicler's responses and judgments. One
                  would prefer a list of sources--beyond question, a history of theory--to take a
                  more disinterested stance. Some may believe that such a stance is impossible in
                  this particular field, but I for one think that the signifi- cance and cogency of
                  a work can be reliably assessed without any particularly strong commitment to one
                  theory or another. Certainly one has assumptions, and principles, and I have tried
                  to state mine in the Introduction above. But principles ought not deter one from
                  recognizing quality or determining typol- ogy. Born in Edinburgh, Omond took his
                  M.A. at St. John's College, Ox- ford; thereafter he moved to Tunbridge Wells, a
                  small town in Kent some forty miles southeast of London, employing himself as a
                  barrister until his death in 1923 (March 1). He is not listed in the DNB. For some
                  time, I have been trying to trace his family, library, papers, and a photograph,
                  but so far without much success. His will stipulates that his papers be destroyed.

               <note> Historically the successor to Guest (E543), the History of English Prosody
                  represents one of the monuments of late Victorian criticism (as Saintsbury himself
                  said of Patmore, the work "simply swarms with crotchety and temer- arious
                  deliverances") and the most extensive effort ever made to trace the po- ets' craft
                  of versifying throughout the entire course of English poetry. The suc- cessor to
                  the History, when it comes, will not be written by a single hand. The second
                  edition is the definitive one, containing eleven Books of historical sur- vey and
                  fifteen Appendices treating specific problems. Since the latter are of more
                  immediate interest for gauging Saintsbury than the former (the historical surveys
                  are likely to be consulted only for specific purposes), I list the Appen- dices
                  herewith, postponing for the moment, however, any discussion of Saintsbury's
                  theories: In vol 1: 1: Equivalence, Substitution, and Foot-Arrangement in English;
                  2: Common Syllables in English, and Degrees in Quantity; 3: The Nature and
                  Phenomenon of Doggerel; 4: Alliteration and its Varieties; 5: English
                  Feet--1200–1600; 6: English Metres--1200–1600; 7: Pause in English--1200–1600; 8:
                  Rhyme--1200–1600; 9: Vowel Music--1200–1600. In vol.3: 1: What Is a foot?; 2: Is
                  the Basic Foot of English Iamb or Trochee?; 3: Trisyllabic Metres Since 1600; 4:
                  Rhyme, 1600–1900; 5: Alliteration and Vowel Music, 1600–1900; 6: An Omnibus Box
                  [Notes and Addenda]. Upon finishing the History, Saintsbury immediately turned his
                  attention to the composition of a more accessible work, a student's manual of
                  versifica- tion, which was intended to be "not so much an abstract as a parallel
                  with a different purpose." This is his Historical Manual, still a very useful book
                  (in many ways much more so than the History), cited below in the chapter on
                  Metrics (E636); Saintsbury's prosodic assumptions, methods, and pronounce- ments
                  are discussed at that point. Saintsbury lived a very full life (1845–1933); he
                  held the Chair of Rhetoric and English Literature at the University of Edinburgh,
                  and he has been accurately assessed by René Wellek as "by far the most influential
                  aca- demic literary historian and critic of the early twentieth century." Over the
                  course of his career, however, the scope (and variety) of his professional publi-
                  cations is staggering. The last of the great generalists, he eschewed the precise
                  and the explicit, while never hesitating an instant to deliver an ex cathedra
                  judgment. With Saintsbury, evaluation came first, understanding later. He has an
                  irrepressibly exuberant, anecdotal prose style that earned him the censure of his
                  contemporaries (Hopkins called it "vulgar"); it is a great pleasure to read-- in
                  small doses--but admittedly it is often fluff. On the other hand, it is occa-
                  sionally incandescent, too. Saintsbury is of that class of critics censured by
                  Eliot as too creative for really accurate analysis. The History of English Prosody
                  is undeniably a great monolith of wide and informed reading. Yet at the same time
                  it must surely stand as one of the most extravagant irrelevancies in criticism,
                  since the instrument, the method, the theory by which the history is conceived,
                  understood, brought into line, and written up is not simply vague or imprecise but
                  actually non-existent-- indeed, consciously ignored and avoided. Saintsbury was
                  all for Taste, Gusto, Elan (this was what Eliot noticed most); he cared not a
                  straw for Precision, Detail, Method, or Proof. In the view of many, therefore, the
                  judgments, de- scriptions, and conclusions of the History--in effect the whole
                  weight of the work--are entirely vitiated by Saintsbury's perverse and willful
                  refusal to ex- plain, either to himself or to us, the assumptions about the nature
                  of meter and verse-structure by which those conclusions were reached. In
                  versification clar- ity about assumptions is not merely indispensable, it is
                  everything. See MacColl's critique at E371 and see D254. There are essays on
                  Saintsbury's opinions and achievement in PMLA 59 (1944): 243–60; (by Wellek) in
                  English Miscellany 12 (1961): 79–96; and in the University of Edinburgh Journal,
                  vol. 6, no. 1 (1933), pp. 30–72 (with two fine photographs). See also Walter

                  Foreign Metres in General Division 2: Verse-Forms Common to the Middle and Modern

                  the Influence of the Renascence, or Introduced Later It has been said that
                  Schipper's table of contents in the English transla- tion is the most thorough,
                  logical, and minute organization of English verse- forms available anywhere; to
                  peruse it is an education in itself. (Some have not thought so, however: Eleanor
                  P. Hammond called it the product of "a mind which must name before it can see and
                  feel.") The translation is heavily reor- ganized in structure but seems much less
                  reworked in content besides the ob- vious trimming of examples, though Schipper
                  does take account of some ar- guments on Old and Middle English metrics published
                  by Luick, Ten Brink, and others after 1881. The absence of an Index in the English
                  edition is a great loss. Each of the five Parts and three Divisions listed above
                  is discussed else- where in the present work, since among the twenty-six chapters
                  of HEV Schipper offers detailed, valuable accounts of Old English meter and the
                  de- velopment of the modern meters in Middle English, as well as useful short re-
                  views of the sonnet form, the Spenserian stanza, the development of blank verse
                  and the couplet, trochaic meters, imitations of classical meters, varieties of
                  rhyme--indeed on virtually every aspect of English versification. Saintsbury's
                  observation that Schipper's monumental work was "one of the foundation stones of a
                  prosodic library" was one of the soundest judgments he ever made in his life.
                  Englische Metrik was not only the first combined his- torical survey and
                  classification of English verseforms made on a truly compre- hensive scale, it was
                  also a study carried out with such theoretical clarity and acumen that subsequent
                  researchers have found very little to quarrel with even after a century. Schipper
                  complained that the German edition sold poorly, and his work had too much of the
                  German drive for order and detail to make it attractive to the English, but I
                  suspect that its sheer presence was an incentive toward the great flood of writing
                  about versification which took place around the turn of the century. The reprint
                  edition will be one of the first acquisitions of the serious student of
                  versification. The bulk of the book (about 70%--this is not obvious from the table
                  of contents) discusses Old and Middle English metrics. The sections which treat
                  modern stanza-forms are mainly catalogues of examples, with a few notable
                  exceptions. This seems an unnatural distribution, and to some extent it simply
                  reflects Schipper's own specialty within English philology, which was Middle
                  English, but it can be justified in part on the grounds that the two principles of
                  modern English meter--syllable-counting and stress-alternation--were first es-
                  tablished in early Middle English, a phenomenon which is only slightly more
                  interesting than its correlate, the disappearance of the Old English meter about
                  the same time. Hence Schipper turns his attention squarely on what is most
                  important. Most of Book I and Parts 1 and 2 of Book II concern pre-1500 forms. On
                  Old English metrics Schipper gives one of the most judicious re- views of the
                  nineteenth-century German scholarship available. He himself ad- heres to the
                  zweihebungstheorie in agreement with Sievers, whose Five Types theory Schipper
                  adopted soon after its appearance. His discussion of Old Eng- lish verse is mainly
                  an exposition of Sievers with examples. On the hypermet- ric lines he accepts the
                  medial-fusion explanation given by Luick and subse- quently endorsed by Sievers.
                  As for the native meter in Middle English, Schipper generally follows Luick (see
                  K223–26, and note K330) in tracing out the loosening form of the alliterative
                  long-line (two-stress hemistichs expand to three; rhyme is added; internal rhyme
                  allows a fracturing of one long-line into a short rhyming couplet) under the
                  pressure of the foreign meters; he seems indeed more interested in the early ME
                  verseforms, as in Layamon, than in the "Alliterative Revival," which had not yet
                  become a bone of contention. Continuity of the alliterative tradition in ME is
                  assumed throughout. The for- eign meters, however, receive a different treatment,
                  being the progenitors of the modern forms. Schipper adopts the traditional
                  (classical) terminology of iambic, trochaic, anapestic, and dactylic feet, even
                  going so far as the obstrep- erous nomenclature for line-ends (brachycatalectic,
                  etc.). He also fails to distin- guish between stress-verse and foot-verse
                  (accentual-syllabic), so that Com- mon Meter, for example, more commonly known as
                  the Fourteener, is de- rived from the seven-foot iambic line in Latin, the
                  Septenary. And he has a few blind spots: the poems of the Gawain-poet, for
                  example, seem scarcely mentioned at all. Yet Schipper is right to identify the
                  foreign sources of mod- ern English versification as double: the influence of
                  Medieval Latin has been se- riously slighted elsewhere. And the traditional
                  account of metrical structure he gives in Chapters 6, 7, and 8 is cogent and
                  useful. Altogether, it is the wide command of English literature and the steadi-
                  ness of judgment that are distinctive in Schipper; he has no bold new theories to
                  display, he borrows much, and his general approach may be fairly described as
                  conservative. But he is remarkably good, not in spite of but in addition to the
                  fact that he was first. I have been unable to trace much biographical informa-
                  tion or (beyond hope) a photograph, but some information will be found in "Zum
                  Gedächtnis Jakob Schipper's," Englische Studien 49 (1915–16): 99–112, and the note

                  many of these are only of very minor interest, even to the fanatical prosodist,

                  chron-ological examination of Keats's remarkably rapid and intense growth in the
                  craftsmanship of verse is, excepting a lamentable repetitiousness of style (the
                  book could have been shorter by a third without a loss), a model of method and
                  accomplishment in the smooth synthesis of (1) detailed and precise description of
                  changes in sound, meter, diction, syntax, and structure, (2) steady retention of
                  the larger biographical and critical framework, and (3) a graceful and engaging
                  style. In short, Bate is precise and informed without allowing either the analysis
                  or the theory (or yet the biography) to become obtrusive. All the major poems re-
                  ceive separate treatment. Of particular note is section 1 of Part 2 on sound-
                  patterning. Cf. Zillman (G149). </note>

               <note> In quest of "a distinct view of the whole range of Spenser's verse." Three
                  peri- ods may be discerned: (1) the early verse, terminating in the Shepheardes
                  Calen- der, is markedly experimental (the three forms of the mature period do not
                  ap- pear at all) and also markedly alliterative; (2) the mature period finds
                  Spenser confining himself to but three forms--rime royal, ottava rima, and the
                  Faerie Queene stanza of nines (this last form allows at once "an extraordinary
                  smooth- ness and ceremoniousness of motion," a sustained evenness of sonority con-
                  trolled by the rhymes); and (3) late work. The occasional poems with their
                  elaborate versification represent special cases. Cf. B224. </note>

                  and so is of direct interest to the prosodist. But see, particularly, Section 2 of

               <note> Eliot used metrical variations in his early work: (1) to distinguish
                  characters, dramatically, and (2) to mark changes in emotional mood or atmosphere.
                  Metrical regularity serves as a "counterbalance to the emotional excitement" of
                  the verse, even as Wordsworth believed. To the more attentive ear, Eliot's rhythms
                  enact his homage to the Elizabethan dramatists. His rhymes convey ironic or comic
                  undercutting, implicit judgment, delayed refrain, or "slightly frenetic
                  over-emphasis"; unexpected absence of rhyme expresses a failure of resolution and
                  creates the frustration of anticlimax. Varieties of formal expres- siveness.

                  process of intellect, "when strong feeling is in any way objectified, a unifying
                  process sets in." The Poetic Principle, then, is "some principle of harmony or
                  fusion" or unity, and its agents are the poetic elements. "Rhythm is a succes-
                  sion and involution of unities, that is, unities within unities," the foot within
                  the verse within the stanza. The elements of form are organic unities with the
                  sense. The book takes five main topics: meter and metrical variation (conven-
                  tional accentual basis); Tennyson's use of the Stanza; the Spenserian stanza; the

                  gether). Segmentation in verse foregrounds its units, establishes them as con-
                  ceptual correlates, and exploits their successive realization by the reader. The
                  poem also bends to its ends specifically poetic signals (not available in prose)
                  and poetically intensified signals (available in prose but heightened in verse).

                  tensity and such we have no term to set against "poetry." Long prose passages are

                  theoretical yet very perceptive reader of poetry who is "in favour of rhyme and

                  [L27–28]); speculates about tonal accent (pitch) in Chinese, English, and
                  Classical verse; argues (from Tennyson and Housman) that quantity is of- ten
                  important in English verse, especially since most of the major poets were taught
                  Latin at school, so that much of their major verse uses "stress and quan- tity at
                  once"; proposes "jammed stress," where several strong syllables in a line are
                  "rolled together" as one stress in scansion; approves of four degrees of stress;
                  emphasizes the paucity of our theories in the face of the instinctive, acute,
                  unconscious human perception of rhythm; and bemoans the abandon- ment of the
                  traditional stress-metric in vers libre, especially in W. C. Williams. Yet, "if
                  the rhythms of English are loose, rich, and confused, as one can hardly deny, how
                  far is poetry in English likely to gain from strict metres?" </note>

                  other hybrid forms: oratorical or rhetorical prose (prose influenced by verse) and
                  euphuism (more extreme: prose influenced by association); cou- plets and blank
                  verse (verse influenced by prose) and intentional doggerel (more extreme); tribal
                  chants, college cheers, and free verse (associative rhythm influenced by verse);
                  the lyric (verse influenced by the associative rhythm) and its more extreme form,
                  here termed "echolalia"; "free prose" (associative rhythms influenced by prose);
                  and aphoristic or wisdom writing (prose influ- enced by associative rhythms).

               <note> As a corrective to some recent work on figurative language in Dryden, this
                  author reasserts Dryden's own priorities of poetic expressiveness--prosody and
                  diction. Three aspects of prosody are distinguished: "harmony of numbers," mimetic
                  rhythm, and the connections of meter and thought in syntax. Har- monious sounds
                  were important to Dryden, and his praise of Virgil suggests some attention even to
                  quantity in English verse. He also believed that a rhythm might carry its own
                  weight of meaning, and hence that each poetic genre had its own appropriate
                  prosody. In syntax, Dryden steadily moved away from the couplet form. Diction,
                  however, he thought more important even than prosody. Words were to be selected
                  which were " apt, significant, and sounding," and of these three, sonority of
                  sound was easily the chief: be- yond everything else, Dryden was concerned not
                  with the referential or se- mantic values of his words, but with the aesthetic.

                  323–409. </bibl>
               <note> Gray's MS notes (written ca. 1760) for his projected History of English Poetry
                  are organized in the Works as six essays, two on meter and stanza, three on the
                  origin and development of rhyme, and one chiefly on Lydgate. These are, re-
                  spectively: (1) "Observations on English Metre," (2) "The Measures of Verse," (3)
                  "Observations on the Pseudo-Rhythmus" [Rhyme], (4) "Some Observations on the Use
                  of Rhyme," (5) "Additional Observations and Conjectures on Rhyme," and (6) "Some
                  Remarks on the Poems of John Lydgate." On metrics Gray tenders his judgment that
                  though the old manuscripts are corrupt, the fault lay with the scribes; the poets
                  show by variance of or- thography that they knew how to make the meter run smooth.
                  Puttenham (E614) is chastised for misunderstanding "Riding Rhyme" and "Rhyme Do-
                  grell," the former of which Gray takes to be iambic in meter but admitting any
                  other foot in any position and with no regularity in length of line. The second
                  essay classifies fifty-nine meters by line-length, stanza-form, and rhyme-scheme.
                  Rhyme is traced back to the Germanic tribes, with Otfrid noticed, be- sides early
                  examples in Hadrian and St. Augustine, and Gray thinks that the custom spread from
                  the Franks to all the other European nations north and south (he follows Hickes
                  closely on this); he denies the French learned rhyme from the Arabs, but rather
                  proposes Church hymns and Latin verses by the monks as the source of rhyme in
                  Provençal. This latter view is however re- nounced in the fourth essay, where Gray
                  concludes the Saxons in England must have learned rhyme from the Britons across
                  the Channel rather than from the Franks (though the Welsh versification had been
                  very advanced from time immemorial) since we see rhyme copiously after the
                  Conquest. On Lydgate Gray offers extensive notes of literary history; the only
                  prosodic matter is the discussion of the state of the language in Lydgate's day,
                  when the great enlargement of foreign words still preserving their native pro-
                  nunciations allowed a "great facility in rhyming" that was later and is now lost
                  to us. </note>

                  ful. Solution: poetry is "a collective term for all poems"; a poem is "a discourse
                  in the form of an arrangement of lines" of "more highly organized sound pat-
                  terns." The relative value of poems, then, can be judged by their degree of

                  sound and meter] appears at i, 51 and ii, 314; he thinks its legitimate province
                  very small: "verse can imitate only sound and motion." </note>

               <note> The article opens by questioning the notion of "content vs. form" and even the
                  isolation of the latter: "there is no pure and independent form . . . . while
                  formal relationships can be perceived without reference to the semantic func- tion
                  of language . . . they cannot be determined, nor can they be analyzed, without
                  referring to the meaning of words." For the analysis of poetry, then, "the primary
                  objects which can be related formally are sounds, with their properties of quality
                  and extension," rather than syntax, meter, or rhyme. The formal elements of poetry
                  may serve three purposes: "organizing, intensifying, and complementing or creating
                  of the total communication"; this latter function has three categories, or modes:
                  "the reinforcing of description by evocation of an external sensible effect"
                  (onomatopoeia and "sense-evoking rhythms" belong here); "the reinforcement of idea
                  by structural embodiment" (as, for example, the musical theme of Stevens' "Peter
                  Quince" becomes con- trolling musical structure); and "the creation of sense
                  through contrast between sound and statement," i.e., tension or irony. The
                  communicative function, then, has three modes, evoking, embodying, and tensioning.
                  Also objectionable are our inept notation systems for marking abstract relations
                  of formal elements, "particularly in the foot system which Saintsbury defended" in
                  metrics. In sum, "poetic form has virtually no value, no interest for the reader,
                  except as it is related to the semantic aspect, as it is understood to function."

               <note> An important general and non-technical essay presenting the notion that "a
                  good number of what we think of as traditional and arbitrary conventions [in
                  poetry] are anchored in grammatical form, and seem to be, at bottom, a con-
                  sequence of how language itself is structured." The principle underlying poetic
                  form is repetition, and as Kiparsky shows, the same abstract pattern (e.g., abab)
                  may be filled by various linguistic elements so as to produce different surface
                  schemas in the poem: if the elements are phonological, then the schema will be
                  rhyme or alliteration; if stress or quantity, then meter; if syntactically
                  equivalent phrases, then parallelism. A theory is sketched out and some surprising
                  conclu- sions derived, e.g., "identity of sound is neither a necessary nor a
                  sufficient condition for rhyme and alliteration." Kiparsky examines at close range
                  syntax, meter, and sound. A synoptic, heuristic, immensely provocative essay.

                  entirely re-thought and re-written throughout from the standpoint of linguistics
                  and on the basis of the most re- cent research. The result, for students and

               <note> "A poem is an aesthetic object composed of language." The linguistic elements
                  of the poem convey sense by performing their ordinary cognitive function, but the
                  conventions of the poem (those treated here: meter, rhyme, the line, en-
                  jambement, and caesura) "have no linguistic significance . . . . the function they
                  perform is a purely aesthetic one." This latter function is ultimately cognitive
                  (i.e., information-producing) as well, but the distinction is nonetheless crucial:
                  in verse, the linguistic elements perform two functions at once. Meter, for ex-
                  ample, is "an abstract schema of periodicity" filled by various linguistic con-
                  stituents. ("The rhythm is more than simply a realization of the meter; it is an
                  amalgam of the meter and the particular suprasegmental features required by the
                  sentences of the poem.") The line is conventionally defined sometimes by the meter
                  but usually by the sound devices, or else a pause. When the pause indicates a
                  strain between language (syntax) and convention (the line), it should be
                  considered enjambement [stipulative definition]. By the same logic caesura is not
                  a syntactic pause at mid-line but rather the force that through the green line
                  drives the meter. Rhyme is a pre-cognitive aesthetic (i.e., uni- fying) convention
                  which may or may not interact with meaning-bearing mor- phemes. All these
                  conventions serve to mark the text as poetic and to "deautomatize" its language,
                  preventing habituated perfunctory responses by the reader, forcing him back to the
                  text with sharpened attention. An excep- tionally tough-minded, incisive paper,
                  which revoked some conventionalities [sic] and so stirred a lively discussion,

               <note> Deviation might be said to be the primary attribute of poetic form. Two types
                  occur: internal (deviation against the norm established by the poem as a whole)
                  and external (the language itself being the norm). Features used systematically in
                  poetry--e.g., meter, rhyme, typography--become conventions, but internal deviation
                  against them is still possible. Phonological deviation--i.e., an unusual
                  distribution of sounds--is mainly external, as is lexical ("poetic diction"),
                  though other types do occur. The problem in explaining external syntactic de-
                  viation is the discernment of the correct norm, which can only be a generative
                  grammar (Levin repeats the arguments of his earlier essay [F126] in large part).

                  Levin's monograph represents the first full-scale application of Jakobson's dic-
                  tum on equivalence as the informing principle of poetic structure (see L65).
                  Levin's theory attempts to account for the "special unity of structure" charac-
                  teristic of poetry by schematizing its use of "equivalent positions as settings
                  for equivalent phonic and/or semantic elements" ("positions" are defined as "those
                  places in the linguistic chain where alternation is possible"). Of equivalences,
                  then, he specifies two types: Type I: Positional a. syntagmatic (syntactic) b.
                  conventional (prosodic) Type II: Natural a. semantic (similar or opposite) b.
                  phonic (echoic). That is, poetry offers two types of seriatim "slots" (syntactic
                  and prosodic) to be filled by the available ("vertical") alternatives in the
                  language. Filling of the correlate syntagmatic positions with equivalent semantic
                  units produces what we normally think of as rhetorical devices such as parallelism
                  and antithesis, and filling with sound produces schemes and sound-patterning.
                  Filling of the prosodic matrix with semantic units that are equivalent produces
                  metrical heightening or emphasis, and filling with sound units the various types
                  of rhyme as discussed by Wimsatt. The crux of Levin's theory is that "poetic"
                  structure is a result of these couplings of Type II to Type I equivalences: possi-
                  bilities are screened then matched and fitted into positions. Is more coupling
                  therefore "more poetic" a priori? Not necessarily. The couplings apparently must
                  be integrated variously with other elements in the poem, and there does seem to be
                  a saturation point (Swinburne comes to mind at once). Levin gives a full-scale
                  specimen analysis of a Shakespearean sonnet. Cf. B60. </note>

                  unitary rather than tripartite. Its true parts are Meter, Cadence, and Rhythm.

                  available on the thorny subject of "poetic language." Mrs. Nowottny demonstrates,
                  through a number of exhibits and extended asides, the complex inter-relations of
                  vocabulary, syntax, meter, and sound in poems which in their joint effect and
                  issue create a "language" of "a recognizably higher degree of patterning" than
                  that of our quotidian speech. Alternatively, we may say, she shows the manifold
                  elements and designs of the semantic construct that is a poem. Chapter 2 tackles
                  the chimera Poetic Dic- tion; chapter 5 treats the "artificial" forms of meter and
                  stanza (explicating the famous elegy on the death of the Countess of Pembroke);

               <note> Apparently also published by the University of Chicago Libraries in a private
                  edition (lithoprint). Olson, later one of the Chicago School critics, wrote his
                  dissertation in search of "principles upon which any verse, if it is to be verse,
                  must found." Those would be the principles of a general prosody, as opposed to
                  those of all the ex- tant treatises in special (i.e., language-specific)
                  prosodies, which Olson believes are mistaken to assume "that a difference of
                  language entails a difference of principle" and "to exhibit conventions rather
                  than forms, and to arrive, not at principles, but at rules." Olson's own
                  principles are that "prosody is not a sci- ence but a part of the analysis of
                  diction in rhetoric and in poetics . . . it is not a matter of rules, nor of
                  notations, nor a history of prosodic conventions, but rather, an enumeration of
                  the modes in which speech-sounds may be com- bined for the embellishment of
                  diction, together with an explanation of such devices in terms of the functions of
                  diction itself." The principle of all verse- structure is "proportionality" (it is
                  "sensibly regular"); the atomic element of general prosody is the syllable, which
                  may be arrayed in regular sequences ac- cording to any of its five
                  characteristics--syntactic position, duration, intensity (accent), pitch, and
                  entity. The most elementary groupings of syllables are termed primary ratios
                  ("feet"), are marked by the presence and absence of em- phasis, and yield
                  primitive rhythms; the next larger groupings, demarcated arbi- trarily and not by
                  emphasis, are termed post-primary ratios and yield post-primary rhythms ("meter").
                  The "foot" is defined (formally) as a unit consisting of one arsis and one thesis
                  (unemphatic and emphatic members), but these members may be actually constituted
                  (materially) by more than one syllable, creating simple (iambic and trochaic) and
                  compound feet; conversely, a foot containing in an anapestic line is an anapestic
                  foot, not an iambic substitution (the defini- tion is formal not actual). A long
                  Appendix provides sample analyses, such as the following, where t stands for
                  thesis, a for arsis: Red River, Red River . . . . . . . . t a t a t a t a The
                  method for finding out the rhythm is ad hoc: one must know the form in advance, or
                  else find some unequivocal feet as indicators. I know of only one application of
                  Olson's system, that by Reeve (G79). </note>

                  344–54. </bibl>
               <note> Responding to earlier criticism, Omond denies that verse is any shackle,
                  primitive form, or unnecessary ornament. On the contrary: "under the inspi- ration
                  of high imaginings," man has always "expressed himself in regular peri- ods"; this
                  is a law for all verse known to man. And this law of "rhythmical ex- pression" has
                  nothing to do with lineation or print; the proper distinction, as Shelley said, is
                  not between verse and prose, but simply between "measured and unmeasured
                  language." In short, some sort of metering principle is a sine qua non for verse.
                  Omond can then defend Whitman as a poet, despite his free-verse lines, on the
                  grounds that whenever his thought becomes most passionate and in- tense, "the
                  language instantly assumes a metrical cadence." </note>

               <note> Here Richards examines and demolishes two assumptions about form in po- etry
                  which appeared in his test protocols. The first is "the notion that regularity is
                  the merit of verse; Richards acknowledges the concept of metrical tension--
                  "departures from and returns to the pattern"--but dismisses it too as suggesting a
                  distinction between the rhythm/sound of words and their meanings. Any such
                  distinction he adamantly denies. The second assumption, then, is "the notion that
                  poetic rhythm is independent of sense." For any who believe that sound patterns in
                  verse have independent meaning or value, Richards offers his famous "dummy" of
                  stanza XV of Milton's "On the Morning of Christ's Nativity." Throughout, Richards
                  insists on the irrefrangibility of Form and Meaning. </note>

                  techniques: they seem not so much controversial as trivial. Her sta- tistical

               <note> Apparently privately printed (typescript on wire-laid paper), this volume col-
                  lects three essays previously printed (E323, D253, J258) and expands them into a
                  full theory of verse-structure, ranging from the basis of rhythm in physiology
                  (Scripture's work) to a theory of meter, with additional chapters on line- length,
                  rhyme, stanza, diction, subject, free verse, prose rhythms, etc. Routh's theory is
                  that verse differs from prose in (1) rhythm, (2) vocabulary, and (3)
                  subject-matter. "The essential quality of verse then is the placing of accents at
                  fixed intervals of time." He allows secondary stresses (promoted or suppressed for
                  the meter) and metrical pauses; his scansions distinguish verse-accent (ic- tus),
                  word-accent, and sense- (sentence) accent, and these are all found to co- incide
                  in four cases out of five. </note>

               <note> Beginning with the conviction that criticism is "a variety of experience which
                  has nothing in common with the art experience, and indeed may be its oppo- site,"
                  Shapiro sets out to show that the rhythmic organization or prosody of a poem is
                  its "meaning." He analyzes a bit of Cummings and offers six conclu- sions: (1)
                  "poetry is not language, but language sui generis which can be under- stood,
                  paraphrased, or translated only as poetry"; (2) "a linguistic sense is car- ried
                  over to a poem from prose and plays a minor part in the workings of the poem"; (3)
                  "the poet thinks as poet not as thinker"; (4) "the translation of a poem is a near
                  impossibility"; (5) "paraphrase is a total impossibility"; and (6) "rhythm is
                  perhaps closer or as close to 'meaning' in poetry as linguistic sense." Would
                  anyone mistake this for formalist criticism? </note>

                  more restricted sense expresses those arrangements of language, and especially
                  metrical language, which are created by that imperial faculty, whose throne is

                  University of Chicago Press, 1968. </bibl>
               <note> The second chapter of this brilliant study treats closure and the formal
                  struc- ture of sonnets, strict stanzaic forms, couplets, blank verse, and free
                  verse. In contrast to what we might otherwise have expected, Smith shows that no
                  for- mal structure per se entails closure: "there is no formal principle which in
                  itself can prevent a poem from continuing indefinitely." Structural repetition,
                  stan- zaic forms, meter, and rhyme may produce effects which can be exploited by
                  the poet to achieve closure, but they do not themselves necessitate it. Sonnet
                  structure will round off one sonnet but does not prohibit a series of sonnets, for
                  example. The couplet at the end of the Shakespearean Sonnet enhances closure by
                  the strategy of "terminal modification," but if the thematic structure is weak no
                  formal structure can be successful alone. In couplet verse the cou- plet has the
                  status of a single formal unit and is therefore equivalent to all the other
                  devices of systematic repetition; in itself its closural resources are very
                  limited. Blank verse achieves closure best by abandoning blank verse, as at the
                  end of the scenes in Shakespeare. Free verse, perhaps surprisingly, offers re-
                  sources fully comparable to those in the other modes. In general, as the con-
                  straints of formal structure weaken, thematic material must take on a greater
                  burden in effecting closure. </note>

                  a very effusive style, but well worth an afternoon's inquiry. The great virtue of
                  the book is that underneath considerable talk of "organic rhythms," "rhythm and
                  imagination the two es- sentials," and the like, Smith fixes on the abstract
                  notion of pattern as the crux of verse-structure. He recognizes the antinomian
                  relation of repetition and variation, and he makes a strong effort to systematize
                  all the various prosodic elements as varieties of a single complex poetic pattern.
                  The treatment of me- ter is especially good: Smith recognizes the tension between
                  "prose stress" and "metrical accent" [ictus] very clearly and derives therefrom
                  five varieties of verse in English: (1) verse in which accent and stress virtually
                  coincide, (2) verse where stresses fall evenly on certain of the accents, (3)
                  faint distortion of the meter by the stress, (4) independent stress pattern, and
                  (5) independent prose movement. </note>

               <note> These very extensive "notes" on metrical technique are careful, methodical,
                  and thorough: from a set of disputed scansions the author derives most of the
                  principles of modern metrics, such as the distinction between meter and rhythm,
                  the Relative Stress Principle (not all the stresses in a line are equally
                  stressed, nor are the unstressed equally unstressed--what counts is relative con-
                  tiguous values), a double-tiered scansion system (two degrees of metrical ictus,
                  five degrees of rhythmical stress), varieties of pauses ("rests," "breaks,"
                  "links"), the effects of word-length on tempo in the line, degrees of enjambment,
                  sonal texturing, and the effects of such texturing (quantity, density, pattern) on
                  tempo also. All of this exemplified in essentially only one Henry Treece poem.

                  158–73; rpt in Gross (A23), pp. 21–41. </bibl>
               <note> This chapter amply contributes to the lucidity of the whole. Wellek distin-
                  guishes at once between performance and pattern (metrics can be based on the
                  latter), (pure) sound and meaning ("there is no 'musical' verse without some
                  general conception of its meaning"), and inherent vs. relational features of sound
                  (the former form the substance of euphonics, the latter of rhythmics and met-
                  rics). Rhyme is anatomized to show the variety of possible approaches, and mi-
                  metic (onomatopoeic) sound--discussed at some length--is divided into three
                  related problems: "actual imitation of physical sounds," "elaborate sound-
                  painting," and "sound symbolism." Theories of rhythm may be classed into those
                  that require some notion of periodicity au fond and those broader ones which do
                  not. Worse, "the very foundations and main criteria of metrics are still
                  uncertain, and there is an astonishing amount of loose thinking and con- fused or
                  shifting terminology even in standard treatises." The types of metrical analysis
                  are the graphic (longs and shorts; simply inapplicable), the musical (merely
                  records a performance), and the acoustic (objective laboratory analysis of sound;
                  ignores meaning and subjective perception). Insisting that meaning is
                  indispensable to metrical theory, Wellek approves of the statistical methods and
                  radical assumptions of the Russian Formalists: "The fundamental unity of rhythm
                  is, then, not the foot but the whole line . . . . Verse is conceived as an
                  elaborate contrapuntal pattern between the superimposed metre and the ordi- nary
                  rhythm of speech." Altogether, the emphasis in this account falls on the primacy
                  of meaning in versification theory. </note>

               <note> Elaborating Northrop Frye's distinction between these two fundamental modes,
                  the aural and the visual imaginations, Welsh inquires into their primitive
                  origins, finding there eight roots of lyric: riddle, emblem, image, vortex, ideo-
                  gram, charm, chant, and rhythm. It is this last (Chapter 9) which interests us:
                  Welsh discusses stress rhythms in Skelton and Wyatt. See also the discussion of
                  rhyme on pp. 226–32, and of stress-rhythms in Beowulf and later, pp. 232–49. B227

                  completely revamped, the section on Skelton being expanded, augmented by a
                  following discussion of Wyatt's meter, and prefaced by a long commen- tary on the
                  development of the pentameter line, for which material Welsh draws heavily upon

               <note> In the fascinating symposium on "Experimental and Formal Verse." Wilbur
                  produces a brilliant defense of the uses and virtues of Form. "No poetry," he
                  thinks, "can have any strength unless it continually bashes itself against the re-
                  ality of things." No "poems made out of poetry." And how can the abstract,
                  gesturing form reproduce the reality? How can it be that "paradoxically it is
                  respect for reality which makes a necessity of form"? How can the poet's com- bat
                  with form enhance his expression? By difficulty. "In each art the difficulty of
                  the form is a substitute for the difficulty of direct apprehension and expression
                  of the object." A sort of distraction, then, or subtler flank attack. Take rhyme,
                  for example: "the presence of potential rhymes sets the imagination working,"
                  providing unexpected possibilities and directions to pursue. Or in meter: surely
                  the poet using meters and stanzas to get at the Real will prefer the "for- midably
                  meaningless" to the "alien." By such means does the poet find his freedoms in
                  restraint. Cf. B16 and E1549. </note>

               <note> A seminal essay: Wimsatt here confronts directly the nature of the verbal me-

                  other function--to refer to the external world. Distinguishing between the gra-
                  phemic and phonetic forms of language, Wimsatt collects eight types of verbal
                  iconicity, together with luminous examples. The schema deployed here is pro-
                  vocative, and more than worthy of book-length treatment. The issue raised is very
                  likely the most crucial one in all of poetics. </note>

                  the "figures" are meter, rhyme, alliteration, etc., and even though we do not have
                  good terms for the faults of taking them to excess, still they are, Wimsatt
                  argues, distinctly meaningful verbal signs, signs which construct a matrix of
                  meaning that is "counterlogical." </note>

               <note> The common (hence confused) usage of the terms "Poetry" and "Prose" fails to
                  distinguish between essences and media; in regard to the former, the proper
                  antithesis is Poetry vs. Non-poetry, while for the latter the terms should be
                  Verse vs. Prose. Can the formal devices of Verse produce effects not obtainable in
                  Prose? No. They can produce other effects, but not necessarily better ones. Most
                  of the world's masterpieces are writ in verse simply on account of con- vention
                  (tradition). Indeed, prose is the more difficult medium because the rules in
                  versifying are aids to composition. Prose allows greater freedom, naturalness, and
                  individuation of rhythms. And "nearly all versification is to some extent a
                  process of fitting thoughts to a form of expression, instead of fitting the
                  expression in every detail to the thought." A wonderfully refreshing, sober,
                  sensible piece of heresy. </note>

               <note>220-37, 254-59. This fourteenth section of the book includes five subsections:
                  (1) Style as Detail of Meaning (2) Qualities of Style (3) The Sound of Poetry (4)
                  Verse (5) Sound and Sense. In the third of these, Beardsley provides a
                  schematization of structural rela- tionships in the sound-stratum of a poem which
                  is more cogent than anything else I have seen: 3
                  Structure----------------------Sound | | 6 | 2 1 | 5 | |
                  Texture----------------------Meaning 4 There are, then, six relations, which
                  Beardsley groups as Sound Quality (tim- bre), Sound Similarity (sonal mimesis or
                  "homophony"), and Sound Pattern (meter). The account which he gives of meter is
                  the traditional one also ar- ticulated in his seminal essay written with Wimsatt
                  (E700). "A stressed syllable introduces a kind of phonetic punctuation in the flow
                  of speech, and breaks up that flow into groups, or feet." Verse consists of two
                  independant organization systems--meter and line. The function of line-division
                  lies in "dividing up the flow of prose into rhythmic sections, thereby introducing
                  new and sometimes very significant emphases and suggestions--slowing it down in
                  smaller units," though divisions on the page are not real unless they "correspond
                  in some way to differences that can be performed and heard." Meter, however, is
                  "neither necessary nor sufficient" to verse. On sonal mimesis Beardsley is
                  willing, cautiously, to go as far as Ran- som, asserting that poetic language
                  seems to aspire to a condition of total mi- mesis, wherein the sound of the words
                  would "dramatize and enact" their meaning. </note>

               <note> Rev: in TLS, 16 February, 1962, p. 104; in Critical Quarterly 4 (1962):
                  265-67; in Quarterly Journal of Speech 50 (1964): 92. From his earlier study of
                  poetic Grammar, Berry extends his horizons to the wider significance of the
                  concept of voice in poetry. We know that every man alive has a distinctive voice,
                  in terms of pitch, duration, volume, timbre, into- nation, overtones, register,
                  reverberation, and echo. We know that a man's voice may change over time. We know
                  that poets are supremely sensitive to the textures of sound. And in the case of
                  some poets we have recorded infor- mation--written or taped--on the nature of
                  their physical speech. We may as- sume that a poet's intonational idiolect will be
                  manifested in his lines, when he is not writing under a persona. Hence, the poet's
                  physical voice ought to be recoverable from his surviving poetry. What a pity it
                  is that Berry did not con- sider the now largely forgotten speculations of Eduard
                  Sievers on precisely this point, intonational idiolects, which he termed
                  schallanalyse. </note>

                  ogy to poetics. On the first level Chatman devalues the importance of "sound
                  symbolism"--i.e. specific phonemes having associated meanings--but empha- sizes
                  the neglected counterview, that "segmental sounds occur in patterns and clusters
                  which have aesthetic effects if not readily discernable meanings." He also upholds
                  the concept of "formal saliency"--i.e., a sound-pattern will inten- C46 sify the
                  lexical import of a phrase regardless of whether it denotes exuberance or
                  grief--and the importance of unusual patterning of sound, e.g. "transitional
                  probabilities" of tempo in Keats. On the suprasegmental level, Trager-Smith's
                  elucidation of pitch, stress, and juncture can resolve ambiguities of interpreta-
                  tion. J. C. McLaughlin is nearly contemptuous in reply (44 (1958): 175-78),

                  model--a dummy eight-line pentameter stanza rhyming a b a b b c b c in which
                  simple patterns of light vs. dark vowels and smooth vs. harsh consonants were
                  deployed, three to a stanza, the patterning recognizably re- petitive but also
                  varied, the test sounds placed only on stressed syllables. Common metrical
                  variations of the pentameter were also built in to test the influence of meter,
                  and the inflections of the reader's voice were also consid- ered. A fascinating
                  curiosity. </note>

               <note> On the relation of sound to meaning in metaphor. Hewitt draws upon neuro-
                  physiology research of the past century to try to show that the best ("opaque"
                  rather than "transparent") metaphors constitute a "coupling" [her term, and
                  Levin's though she does not draw upon him] between aural complexity and semantic
                  density or opacity. In short, the left hemisphere of the brain responds to the
                  verbal/semantic aspects of the metaphor [all speech, in fact] while the right one
                  responds to the nonverbal, purely aural patterning. That is why an appeal to
                  either side of the brain is unsatisfying to us; in the best verbal art both
                  hemispheres are engaged simultaneously. Further, poets may turn this neurological
                  state of affairs to advantage, whenever the sense of their verse is particularly
                  formidable, "by fusing parts or series of difficult lines with a strong sound
                  pattern which persuades us, even when we cannot see clearly the sense pattern,
                  that the lines have an integrity, a wholeness as poetry." These two features,
                  sonal and semantic complexity, may be set as the axes of a Cartesian graph for
                  purposes of mapping relations of poems. </note>

               <note> "The elements of which literary structures are composed are of course the lin-
                  guistic elements of sound and meaning." In the older tradition, all the relations
                  between these elements were classed as Grammar (i.e. Linguistics), Rhetoric,
                  Logic, or Poetics (Aesthetics). The latter, poetic, function is simply "coherence
                  of structure" per se, and thus the poetic impulse will organize any or all of the
                  aspects of language available to it indiscriminately and without any a priori or-
                  der; these aspects are sound, qua sound, and meaning. The purely aesthetic
                  structuring may be of the intrinsic features of sounds, or of meanings, usually
                  both, and the structuring of the one may lie in parallel, contrast, counterpoint,
                  or other relation to that of the other. At present, however, we know the ele-
                  ments and structures of sound far better than any of those for meaning. Yet, La
                  Drière concludes, "the semantic structure of poetry is more like the poetic
                  structure of sounds than it is like the semantic structures of logic, or of rheto-
                  ric, or even of grammar so far as those exist." At a high level of abstraction,
                  the essay ranges widely; the reader may wish to begin on p. 97. </note>

               <note> Lynch devises a procedure for assessing the degree of "compound phonetic ef-
                  fects" in poems: by marking each occurrence of a phoneme as 1 and adding 1 every
                  time the phoneme (a) falls under metrical ictus, (b) bears linguistic stress, or
                  (c) is conspicuously repeated, a ratio of its quantitative to qualitative im-
                  portance may be derived. In Keats's sonnet on Chapman's Homer, five vowels and two
                  consonants predominate, and six of these seven appear in what is the thematically
                  summative word of the poem, "silent." Thus the purely aural pattern peaks at
                  precisely the same nexus as the semantic. Lynch looks for confirmation of this
                  principle in seven other poets. But note that he reads the Keats poem with
                  standard American pronunciation. See Hymes (C68). </note>

                  choice of a word for its contribution to a mellifluous Vergillian sound-pattern.

                  emphasis falls on the mechanism--if such it may be called--of analysis. The
                  introductory discussion of "Bond Density" and pattern-types is more generally
                  systematic. </note>

               <note> Masson posits three fundamental types of sound patterning in poetry: sequence

                  each of which may be compounded nearly to infinity by subpatterning. Sonal
                  expressiveness he finds may arise from three sources: acoustic, kin- aesthetic, or
                  lexical (i.e., associative, either normal-lexical, nonce-lexical, or im- pressed
                  elements). Copious examples from all the European poetries. </note>

                  (1977): 181-83. </bibl>
               <note> A timely yet durable book: Adams has caught us at a blind spot--we have had no
                  full-scale study of the three commonest forms of structural sound- patterning--and
                  his gracefully harmonious rectification of our lapse spans a gulf much wider than
                  1660-1800; indeed, though his primary focus is the eight- eenth century, his reach
                  extends with ease from Chaucer to the present, and even beyond English. Chapter 1
                  presents definitions, a wide-ranging survey of the importance of these devices,
                  and a long side-glance at "phonetic symbol- ism" (pp. 24-35): Chapter 2 treats
                  Dryden; 3, Pope; 4, the minor 18th century poets; and 5, 19th and 20th century
                  poets, especially Browning. Adams wears much learning lightly (do not fail to see
                  the three long background Notes in the footnotes to chapter 1), matching the
                  neatness and precision of informed scholarship with a colorful, dapper style and a
                  keen ear for poetic resonance. Note the definitions of the three key terms given
                  on pp. 3, 9, and 15: signifi- cant patterning is confined to stressed syllables.

               <note> Over the course of his career Thomas moved from an intense interest in con-
                  sonance, to later, more subtle patterns of assonance, and, near the end, back to
                  true rhyme. In general his last-line sounds are not easy near-rhymes but a highly
                  sophisticated, complex, and exacting system of varieties of consonance which he
                  developed. These, "dreary to enumerate," Astley maps out here: from Yeats Thomas
                  learned consonance; from Owen he learned "zero conso- nance" (all syllables ending
                  in open (though different) vowels have identity of absence of following
                  consonants) and "frame rhyme" (alliteration + conso- nance); to these Thomas added
                  "partial consonance" and "close consonance" to complete his inventory. (All terms
                  are Astley's.) </note>

                  for order and beauty in the design of his aesthetic objects, given the starkness
                  of his subject and the horror of his situation. </note>

               <note> Though stiff, Surrey's blank verse shows us "a certain severe dignity," espe-
                  cially in vowel echoing, which Surrey is better at than we think he is. His
                  limitation in using assonance (consonance also, to some degree) subtly is that he
                  confines it nearly always to ictic (stressed) syllables, rarely letting the reso-
                  nances of the echoes flow all across the verse. But in elevated passages (of blank
                  verse, remember) Surrey allows a very copious usage of rhyme and near- rhyme. This
                  wide attention to vocalic echo is preserved in the MS revisions made for Tottel's
                  edition of Surrey's poetry, and its presence in those poems put into Tottel's
                  Miscellany had a demonstrable effect on the verse of Surrey's contemporaries and
                  successors. His music was noticed, emulated, and refined. What were his sources?
                  Not Virgil or Wyatt but the Italian writers of versi sciolti. An admirable essay.

               <note> Three matters are addressed: (1) devising an adequate system for analyzing al-
                  literative patterning (double, triple, and quadruple echoes of single
                  alliteration, double alliteration (these are all horizontal patterns), and
                  vertical patterns span- ning two, three, four, and more lines); (2) the adequacy
                  of such information as evidence for dating and chronology; and (3) correlations
                  with thematic devel- opment in the poem. Sonnets 1 and 129 are analyzed closely.
                  Shakespeare was more skillful and subtle at alliteration than his contemporaries;
                  his patterns in general are "as remote from inane plethora as they are from
                  indiscriminate or- namentation." He was particularly adept at interlace and at
                  loading the crucial, summative couplet of the sonnet with the weighty ore of
                  alliteration. Chronologically his technique developed toward wider spans of
                  echoing. N.B.: Pirkhofer only counts alliterations on metrically stressed
                  syllables. </note>

                  Unfortunately, though, the letters alliterate more frequently than the sounds,
                  spellings of vow- els being so erratic in English, so that when Scott finds

                  Assessment of degree of intention, however, is something else. Skinner tabulates
                  not only frequencies of echo by line but also the distribution of the spans of
                  echoing; the functional limit of span seems to be four syllables though echoes do
                  occur as far away as eight syllables from the original. Swinburne uses more
                  alliterations and at wider spans than Shakespeare does (the "coefficient of
                  alliteration" for the former is four times that for the latter), but on the other
                  hand he seems not to develop consonance at all and actively suppresses asso-
                  nance. </note>

               <note> A sharp rejoinder to B. F. Skinner on alliteration in Shakespeare's sonnets
                  (C160), criticizing his methods and conclusions. Skinner's tabulations of oc-
                  currences led him to conclude that the alliterative effects were mainly random;
                  Stoll insists they are artful, noting that in order for alliteration in one line
                  to be conspicuous, its consonants must be suppressed (unobtrusive) in others,
                  which is what the tabulation showed--low frequencies in a number of lines.
                  Further, Skinner confined his analysis to the single line, whereas it is commonly
                  known that poetic alliteration extends itself more widely. And even though it is
                  im- portant to bear in mind the base-line of the chances for random occurrence,
                  poetry proceeds by appearance and effect not by frequencies or probabilities.

               <note> Two functions are served by the rhymes of the Chorus's speeches: one is
                  ironic, undercutting their credibility ("they state their confusions in assured
                  rhymes, as though they were speaking imperishable truths"); the other occurs at
                  the conclusion, conveying a sense of wisdom gained, finality, and tranquility.

               <note> Not only do the most common rhymes seem the most obvious and facile, they also
                  suggest certain predetermined, necessary, invariable semantic relationships in the
                  language or even, almost, in the world beyond referential language; "every real
                  language, every language accessible to poets, affirms hints of a shattered
                  perfection. Order, congruence, universal truths, these a poet might hint at by
                  careful exploitation of such few congruous rhymes as his tongue placed at his
                  disposal." Pope was a master at this, especially in The Rape of the Lock, but a
                  further beguiling sidelight on the whole issue appears in the pecu- liar artifical
                  languages devised by Bishop Wilkins and others and so faddish in the eighteenth

                  into the acoustical- phonetic basis of rhyming, and experimental researches were
                  indeed carried out. But the results is more discursive than anything else, Lanz
                  rarely de- scending to specific analysis. However, the work is by no means limited

                  rhyme. But there are valuable examples throughout, and the Bibliography is also

               <note> In Lectures 23, 24, and 25, Marsh makes the case in full for the old view that
                  English, being a positional rather than an inflectional language, suffers a pau-
                  city of rhyme words. Taking, then, a very broad purview, he urges a return to the
                  devices of the archaic Anglo-Saxon poetry--alliteration, assonance, conso- nance,
                  internal rhyme--as well as a wider employment of Romance and Lati- nate words.
                  Also sketched is the history of accent-shift in English. Final note: in Marsh (p.
                  553) one can see the clearest example of the semantic shift in the term consonance
                  during the last century. </note>

                  from the divine Logos, even as Nature was derived from the Godhead; therefore,
                  "everything else, his vision of nature and the self in their relations to God,
                  hangs on the question of the nature of language." So too the nature of
                  rhyme--similarity-within-difference--becomes a metaphor for the relation of man to
                  God, and hence a central focus of this central poem. </note>

                  principle. "There is one possible mode of harmony and only one. By gradually

                  his isolation, and conquers that proximity to God for which he longs." The harmony
                  of all things in the world is found in their rhyming, and thus the complete
                  extension of this principle into every corner of versification is "the fundamental
                  method of Hopkins' poetry." Ex- tended analysis of "Pied Beauty." </note>

               <note> A purely phonetic analysis of rhyme is markedly inferior to a semantic
                  analysis; in a semantic typology of rhyme three levels are discernible: (1) on the
                  diffuse level one perceives the "channeling" from the sonorous stratum to the
                  seman- tic stratum which the rhyme effects, and one can distinguish degrees of
                  rhymedness in poems; (2) on the vertical level the rhyme establishes the princi-
                  ples of recurrence and analogy wherein each rhyme-couple, by generating a narrow
                  "framework" of semantic oppositions or categories, constructs one part of the
                  stylistic-semantic field comprised by the whole text. (3) on the horizontal level
                  the chief effect of the presence of a rhyme is "the disintegration of word-
                  order." In terms of content, four situations obtain: (1) the classical rhyme
                  suggests semantic similarity via sonal; (2) ironic rhyme reverses that direction;
                  (3) sub- stantial rhyme controls the ordering of content within the line by its
                  inherent semantic weight or "brilliance"; (4) secondary rhymes, by contrast, are
                  unob- strusive and weak. These four content relationships correspond to the four
                  functions of rhyme--(1) Demarcation between lines, (2) Break of syntactic or- der,
                  (3) establishment of Parallelism, and (4) Cementation of the aesthetic ob-
                  ject--in the following manner: (secondary = ) D &lt;------------&gt; P ( =
                  classical) | | (substantial = ) B &lt;------------&gt; C ( = ironic) The first two
                  functions are diremptive, the latter two cohesive. Breaking op- poses Cementation
                  as Demarcation opposes Parallelism, while Demarcation is reinforced by Breaking
                  and Parallelism by Cementing (fusion). </note>

                  (types), distribution, and causes for the decline of rhyme in Shakespeare. (For a
                  definition of the ten varieties of rhyme isolated here and a catalogue of all
                  occurrences in the canon go directly to Appendix B.) Ness concludes that
                  Shakespeare decreased his reliance on rhyme not in response to any contemporary
                  critical or theatrical fashion but because as he matured he came to see its
                  effects as distinctly limited (mainly to augmentation and to clinching or tying
                  off a speech or scene). See also chapter 5 and Appendix C for an analysis of
                  metrical variation, rhyme forms, and structure in the couplets of each play.

               <note> A landmark study which takes its origin in the data of Diekhoff (C206) and
                  then proceeds to demonstrate that end-rhyme in Paradise Lost is merely part of a
                  larger, firmer, more complex, more subtle pattern, "a co-ordinated, highly
                  organized treatment of terminal phonetic echoes" which Milton learned from Italian
                  versi sciolti. Oras gives a detailed analysis of phonic patterning in Paradise
                  Lost, Book I ll. 1-83. and ll. 547-62, and Book VI, ll. 56-74. Such proof of
                  Milton's attention to the ends of his verses implies that he had a firm sense of
                  the line as metrical unit, as well as the verse-paragraph. Finally, his echoing
                  technique may also be considered the "assonantal equivalent of his rhyming

               <note> This essay should be a full counterweight to the prosodic platitude that

                  of fifteen types and one miscellaneous group of five principal types of "phonetic
                  corre- spondences preceding the lst metrically stressed vowel," then gives a
                  detailed typological and statistical analysis of each. Oras more than amply makes
                  his point that Spencer considered multiple correspondences a richening of the
                  aural texture of his verse. Orderly, sensitive, elaborate, undogmatic analysis.

               <note> Seeking to revise the older view of Miltonic rhyming as desultory and vestig-

                  experimentation, and structural "blurring" with artful sprezzatura, each para-
                  graph imitating in its crescendo movement the movement of the poem as a whole.

                  appended ta- bles of forms and statistics. Similar to Dougherty (D273) yet
                  considerably denser in both fact and generalization, Perloff's work is invaluable
                  for the study of semantic patterning in rhyme. Of the 386 poems in the Variorum
                  Yeats, only 16 are in blank verse, and as Delmore Schwartz noticed, rhymecraft was
                  apparently indispensable for Yeats's creativity. Perloff establishes some ten se-
                  mantic categories of rhyme (open to some question, I think), which allow her to
                  explore the strategies of advance and development which rhymes provided Yeats in
                  the writing of a poem. </note>

               <note> Poe's actual practice in rhyming was flagrantly inconsistent with his critical
                  dicta censuring "license." He often resorted to slant rhyme, variance of pro-
                  nunciations, contrived proper names, rich rhymes, and heavy internal rhyme. But
                  most distressing of all is the "fundamental poverty" of his rhymes, so glar- ingly
                  obvious, expected, and repetitious. </note>

                  scope of a full-length work of scholarship, its thesis is carefully reasoned.
                  Analysis reveals that Crashaw's rhyme vocabu- lary was surprisingly small, yet he
                  frequently elaborated only a few rhymes (and often the same words) into enormously
                  complex schemes; these preferential repetitions of words and sequences reveal that
                  certain words became, in rhyme, "compressed versions of the complexes of
                  association" which were central to Crashaw's thinking. </note>

                  range (44 patterns in 62 stanzas) though a smaller corpus (George used 48 patterns
                  in 169 stanzas). Both poets easily outdistance their contem- poraries in
                  inventiveness; only Donne and Wyatt compare. Too, both of the brothers show
                  similar characteristics: pattern poems, the echo-device, rare stanza-forms, and

               <note> Interesting observations here: rhymes can serve as evidence for historical
                  pro- nunciation; in the case of imperfect rhymes often "similarity of spelling is
                  now accepted as covering the want of any real identity in the vowel sounds"; more
                  than a fifth of the imperfect rhymes in a thousand lines are in words where the
                  vowel is followed by an -r; Tennyson thought the utility of rhyme to be that "it
                  helps the memory"; and the spelling of rhyme with an -h is both recent and
                  erroneous, based on false etymology with rhythm (of Greek origin)--the old
                  spelling for echoing sound was rime, with the variant rhime meaning simply
                  "verse." </note>

                  into finished luster, Byron generally preferred to retain a rhyme-word when he was
                  forced to recast a line, and when he was forced to change an entire rhyme he
                  usually did so in the final couplet, since that alteration had the least effect
                  else- where in the stanza. A very interesting study. </note>

               <note>Rev: in Archiv 182 (1943): 57-59. Far more sophisticated than the usual
                  treatment: the author (a student of Wilhelm Horn) examines the ways in which the
                  language plays with sound through rhymes, via their Klangkorper, construing
                  similarity and difference si- multaneously, the effect of rhyme being related to
                  that of the joke. Structurally the rhyme weights the movement of the line toward
                  its end and leads it into other lines, unlike alliteration. The impediment of the
                  rhyme-sound forces the poet to think in terms of the larger stanzaic architecture.
                  The dialectic of "pure" and "impure" rhymes is carried on deep in the structure of
                  the lan- guage--e.g. in sound-shifts--and though most poets are inclined toward
                  con- servatism in rhyming (since legitimacy here is defined socially), some poets
                  are fairly radical--e.g. Keats. Rhyme also entails a balance of strophic unity
                  against echo-purity. The twentieth century, though, has been content with only ap-
                  proximate echo. This is a study showing both a subtle understanding and also
                  methodological expertise. </note>

               <note> Half-rhyme (e.g. cold/called) was used prior to Owen by Hopkins, Dickinson and
                  Vaughan; possibly he learned the technique from Welsh, but a more likely source is
                  the French poet/prosodist Jules Romains. Functionally it both suited Owen's
                  temperament and conveyed the sense of frustration, dissonance, and unease so
                  appropriate for the war-poems. Moreover, Owen chooses his rhyme-pairs so that
                  almost invariably there is a drop in pitch from the first to the second, the drop
                  that we associate with despair, or incompletion. . . . </note>

                  essay on the semantic functions of rhyme, especially in Chaucer and Pope. Wimsatt
                  sets himself the task of explicating the "counterpattern of alogi- cal
                  implication" established in rhyme (as examplar of all formal devices in verse)
                  against or above the lexical-logical meanings built up by the words in the lines.
                  Indeed, his point is precisely that the "logic" of the verse-forms must run
                  counter to the sense of the lines or else the whole complicate tissue of "tension
                  and resilience" is lost. Rhyme-structures examined are homoeoteleuton, true rhyme,
                  and chi- asmus. Of Pope, Wimsatt concludes that his rhymes are characterized
                  chiefly by the use of different parts of speech or by the same parts of speech
                  used in different functions. </note>

                  Augustan poetics: though a very fixed and accepted convention, it was nonetheless

                  of magnitude in speech-sounds regardless of meaning, constructed sets of
                  minimal-pairs of nonsense syllables contrasting one phonetic feature (mainly /a/

                  the smaller. Sapir speculated that the causes of symbolism might be "acoustic or
                  kinesthetic or a combination of both . . . the factor of linguistic interference

               <note> Following a critical review of the literature on the subject (suggesting
                  faults in experimental design) and a synopsis of the author's earlier work, Taylor
                  for- mally states her theory that phonetic symbolism is not to be found in any
                  anal- ogy of the physical properties of sound to the physical properties of real
                  objects (as a universal linguistic phonemenon) but rather in the "language habits"
                  spe- cific to each language [the term is undefined, but seems to mean no more than
                  "conventions"], so that the basic process is one of association rather than imi-
                  tation: "once a certain sound has thus become associated with a certain mean- ing,
                  then within that language a cluster of words of similar meaning may come to employ
                  similar sounds." See the detailed criticism of this theory by Weiss (C361),

               <note> Retesting of Wertheimer's hypothesis (C362) revealed an unnoticed differen-
                  tial between the symbolism of nouns and verbs, which brings to mind Jesper- sen's
                  observation that words denoting movement would be the most likely symbolic.
                  Conclusion: "phonetic symbolism cannot be seen as having in any sense an existence
                  prior to, or independent of, meaning categories, but must instead be considered a
                  psychological response, initiated or suggested by (word) meanings, which then
                  allows such meanings to becomes attached to otherwise meaningless sounds." </note>

               <note> Experiments reported here did not find any correlation between high degree of

                  would suggest that phonetically symbolic words are more perceptible, hence would
                  be naturally selected as the language evolves, making the lan- guage increasingly
                  richer in that respect, rather than increasingly abstract.) Verbs are shown higher

               <note> On two short pages (267-68) Whorf makes three deft points: humans "seem to

                  quick, high-pitched, narrow. . . with each other, and conversely . . . dark, warm,
                  yielding, soft, blunt, low, heavy, slow, low-pitched, wide, etc."; we are likely
                  to notice if the words for such experiences share similar characteristics (esp.
                  vowel features) with them, but we usually do not notice a relation of contrast or
                  conflict; even if a word has a "sharp" sound, if it denotes "tender- ness" it will
                  be heard as "sounding," subjectively and culturally, tender. See also: B156, C171,

                  Symbolism: A Study of the Affective Content of English Phonemes." </bibl>
               <note> This important new approach to the problem of phonetic symbolism offers much
                  more refined results than the crude traditional terminology by treating the
                  symbolic potential of the phoneme as a regular element in generative pho- nology.
                  Assuming that "while phonemes always 'have meaning' they are not always expressive
                  of their meaning," Anderson proposes tagging each phoneme with an "Affect"
                  feature, which operates by regular rules unless it is "masked" by other lexical
                  features. Rules are derived. Since the symbolism of a mor- pheme does not appear
                  in isolation but only within structures, four possible relations may obtain
                  between its lexical features (meaning) and phonological features, giving four
                  degrees of "fit" between the two: PHONOLOGICAL MAKE-UP - + MEANING - -- random +-
                  Appropriate fit but non-poetic + -+ Only appropriate fit in poetry ++ “poetic”
                  Other Stylistics Rules mark repetitions of symbolic features to produce a hier-
                  archy of eight degrees of value for types of structural repetition within or
                  across lines. Anderson's treatment is a quantum leap over the methodology of
                  earlier studies. </note>

               <note> The rise of science and deterministic philosophy in the seventeenth century,
                  the explicit analogy between poetry and music so central to the Renaissance, and
                  the Augustan social doctrine of "correctness" all led to the doctrine of "harmony
                  of Numbers" in Baroque poetic theory, a doctrine all the more cu- rious because it
                  entailed a complete emphasis on sound over sense, on sound as pure sensuous
                  pleasure, and hence on the irrational over the rational in poetry. In contrast,
                  the Augustan view, as seen in Pope's statements in the Essay on Criticism,
                  represented "a transformation of that tradition [so as] to bring poetic imitation
                  in accord with nature as revealed by Hobbes." Meaningless sound, so esteemed in
                  the seventeenth century, had reversed its fortunes entirely by 1711. </note>

                  features (high-low, front-back) suggesting non-linguistic features such as size or
                  shape (large-small, round-angular, smooth-rough), then turns to the Paget-
                  Johannesson-Blackmur theory of "language as gesture" (i.e., language evolved as
                  the tongue, mouth and speech-organs imitated gestures in the external world).
                  Sapir, for example, thought that sounds which suggested size corre- lated roughly
                  with the size of the mouth-cavity required to make them. </note>

                  Thomas's career, tracing patterns of development: Thomas's poetry evolves from an
                  earlier idiom that is "staccato in its rhythm and compressed . . . to a later
                  poetry that is legato in its rhythm and expansive--often uncompli- cated--in its
                  sense"; from highly regular meters to more diverse, varied, ir- regular
                  stress-patterns; from strongly end-stopped to usually enjambed lines and larger
                  units of thought; from sound used to point up a phrase or line, through sound used
                  to contrast or characterize passages, to sound-patterns highly autonomous,
                  extended, and complicate; from an early style dense in consonants and plosives to
                  a late reliance on vocalic resonance and extension; Throughout, Thomas used his
                  tools of stress, pitch, intensity, and pattern to body forth, chiefly, his sense.

                  Pope skewer the features of incompetent versification (hiatus, monosyl- labic
                  clutter, filler words, easy rhymes, pretentious alexandrines) for all to see, and
                  not only does he remind us that the verse must enact, sonally and metri- cally,
                  what it describes, but he also insists, first and last, that Numbers are not the
                  final value of verse--what counts above all is the Thought. </note>

               <note> Beginning at the eighth paragraph, Ransom faces squarely the possibility of
                  sounds in poetry suggesting meaning, knocking it flat to the ground: "I am
                  compelled to believe that the sound effects . . . are remarkable but do not
                  'promote' any particular meaning at all." His method of proof entails replacing
                  the phonemes in the lines with very similar ones in the same order, but mak- ing
                  up different words, then asking if the supposed meanings remain. This is a visible
                  blow, yet one may remember that in logic, arguments by analogy have no logical
                  validity. </note>

               <note> A delicately subtle defence of the virtue of all types of arbitrariness in

                  nec- essary fiction that the sounds of words are magically accurate and
                  adumbrative names, and anything but arbitrary assignments. Ricks' wonderful
                  examples show that poets exploit both the visual and the aural arbitrariness of

               <note> Notes three theories of phonetic symbolism: Onomatopoeia (vowel sounds imitate

                  sound symbolism). Then suggests another variety--Kinesthesia. A careful analysis
                  of Dr. Johnson's strictures on "representative meter" in The Life of Pope

               <note> In Stein's view, modern criticism has erred in its fixation on semantic
                  content, which regulates style to a dependent position. He finds Milton's verbal
                  harmo- nies more subtle and sweeping than Donne's, elaborating on imitative sound-
                  patterning in five examples (ranging from such elementary mimetics as "the
                  extravagant mouthing necessary to read the words" to more sophisticated fugues of
                  vocalic enunciation, "propelled outward with great energy and then sustained in a
                  widening sound"), taking the trouble to scourge D. R. Roberts (N113) repeatedly
                  for "shallow" analysis, and concluding finally that the sounds are in fact not
                  imitative at all, but constitutive: "the pattern of sound does not reinforce an
                  already established meaning so much as it helps shape and modulate that meaning."

                  The widely endorsed structural-linguistic description of the phonology and
                  morphology of the English language (though soon after challenged by
                  transformational-generative grammar, of course). The core of the Trager-Smith
                  system is the identification of four discrete levels of stress (i.e. primary,
                  secondary, tertiary, weak), pitch (highest, high, normal, low), and juncture
                  (internal, and word-, phrase-, and clause-terminal). The four-level description of
                  stress was immediately seized by prosodists and applied to metrics with its
                  two-level (bivalent, on-off, yes-no) ictic system, since it was apparent that the
                  two medial degrees of stress could be "promoted" or "demoted" depending on context
                  to either fully stressed or weak. See the subsection on Structural Metrics

               <note> An important argument for its bearing on metrical theory. Accepting Pike's
                  view of English as "stress-timed" (originally suggested by Sir Joshua Steele) and
                  Ladefoged's definition of stress as "a gesture of the respiratory muscles,"
                  Abercrombie argues that this gesture "has nothing to do with loudness"--i.e., the
                  pause is completely phonological and not extra-linguistic. Some of its functions
                  are: syntactic, emphatic, terminal, tentative, and rhetorical. In verse, these
                  silent stresses or metrical pauses (1) insure a regular number of beats in the
                  line, and (2) serve as line-end markers. </note>

                  on English: Ellis distinguishes as primary features length, pitch (frequency),
                  force (amplitude, loudness), form (timbre), and glide. Accent is the result of
                  specific variances in pitch and force; emphasis adds to these the expressive uses
                  of form and length. A capsule definition: English accent may be defined as fixed
                  force and free pitch. Interestingly, Ellis gives a very detailed synopsis of the

               <note> As if philology (here, phonetics) had failed historically to rescue (i.e.
                  explicate) meter, now metrics will come to the aid of its substantive, phonology.
                  In a major theoretical statement, the authors propose a theory wherein the
                  stressing of English syllables is determined, on the deep level, by "the alignment
                  of linguistic material with a 'metrical grid,'" a process which is "reminiscent of
                  the traditional picture of verse scansion, so that the theory as a whole deserves
                  the name 'metrical.'" Thus, in the Liberman-Prince procedure, one simply marks
                  relative prominence at the constituent level, then allows the standard Compound
                  and Nuclear Stress Rules to apply to the derivation of both word-stress and
                  phrase-stress. But there are cases in which stressing shifts unexpectedly in order
                  to preserve alternation of stressed and unstressed syllables (i.e. to avoid
                  contiguous clashing stresses); this phenomenon the theory accounts for via an
                  optional Rhythm Rule, whereby the metrical grid realigns itself systematically, a
                  process the authors term "scansion." Intriguing . . . that the structure of verse
                  could explicate the structure of the language. See Nanni (D98), Kiparsky (E826),
                  and Chen (L1542). </note>

                  patterning in simple sounds (clicks or beats, which could be varied in intensity,
                  duration, timing, and grouping), human motor responses, human speech-sounds, as
                  well as other sensory stimuli, music, and dance, have generally drawn a
                  fundamental distinction between objective rhythms (what is actually spoken or
                  produced) and subjective rhythms (what the mind "hears" or constructs out of what
                  it is given, based on expec- tation, projection, and an astonishing internal
                  mechanism for the simplification and hierarchical ordering of complex recurrent
                  stimuli). There have been many studies, and those which have examined sets of
                  linguistic and prelinguistic sounds have frequently employed the terminology of
                  versification, calling the groupings of features trochaic, anapestic, etc. Very
                  often these studies have also applied their findings about clicks, taps, and
                  nonsense syllables directly to verse, drawing conclusions about the nature of
                  poetic meter or rhythm. In most of these studies the subjective aspect of rhythm
                  is understandably given primary attention; hence the title above. </note>

                  example, a "dipodic" grouping principle usually appears). The three aspects of

               <note> A study of rhythmic grouping in speech. Children were given lines of a
                  repeated syllable and asked to read them aloud in varying configurations of
                  stressing, pitches, and time-groupings. For involuntary rhythmical grouping,
                  "primary rhythm" (equal pausing after every syllable) came most naturally,
                  followed by time-grouping, wherein time preceded stress and pitch as the most
                  important principle of grouping. Rather extensive conclusions (pp. 533–60) are
                  drawn from all this, the most relevant of which is that the trochee seems to be
                  the most natural grouping-form. The children found amphibrachs and anapests nearly

                  frequency of the tones constant but varying the durations of both tones and
                  silences, six configurations are possible. Which will be perceived as "iambic" and
                  which "trochaic"? The hypothesis that longer tones will be perceived as accented
                  and shorter as unaccented was confirmed, as was a second hypothesis that "in the
                  absence of any objective cue for rhythmic perception . . . a trochaic rhythm [will
                  be] induced." Twenty-one varieties of triadic units are possible, of which seven
                  were tested here; results agreed with those for duple units. The methodologies of
                  Stetson and Woodrow are criticized. Conclusion: variance in temporal structure
                  alone "is a sufficient objective condition for the perception of order and accent

                  were able to discriminate between five degrees of deviation, which are termed
                  rhythm limens. But they were able to apprehend deviations of time before they
                  perceived deviations of rhythm; the former seem to be a series of discrete points,
                  the latter a curve or field. The tempo of a rhythmic series has important effects
                  on auditors, the most preferred rate being 120 clicks per minutes, or from .5 to
                  .6 seconds per interval. Still, when intervals were irregular, the series was
                  heard as trochaic rather than iambic. Also studied were auditors' abilities to
                  estimate a mid-tempo halfway between two given tempos. </note>

               <note> Experimental work showing that a trochiac rhythm can be changed to an iambic
                  one "by increasing the interval immediately following the louder sound or by
                  decreasing the interval immediately preceding it." When the intervals between
                  sounds are equal but every other sound is raised in intensity, hearers perceive
                  the sequence as trochaic: "a regularly recurring difference in intensity exerts a
                  tendency towards rhythmical groups with the more intense sound at the beginning."
                  This sort of work is important for any theory about the perception of poetic
                  rhythm or meter. PROSE RHYTHM Over the course of the past century a number of
                  metrists who studied English verse also turned their attention to
                  stress-patterning and other forms of rhythmic organization in prose as well,
                  partly because they recognized that verse is made up of the syntactic structures
                  of prose and partly because they were interested in the tradition of consciously
                  rhythmical prose which stretched back from Joyce, DeQuincey, and Sir Thomas Browne
                  through the medieval Latin cursus to the highly stylized cadences of classical
                  Latin prose. Efforts to show the presence of the cursus-patterns in the modern
                  languages, however, have been thwarted by the fact that many of these patterns are
                  identical to the stress-patterns of the naturally occurring phrases--a fact which
                  has considerable significance in itself. The whole area is of peripheral interest
                  to versification, so I cite sources without discussion. </note>

               <note> In contrast to prose, poetry is spoken: (1) at a slower rate; (2) in shorter
                  tone-units; (3) with more pauses; (4) in units relatively equal in length; (5) at
                  a lower average pitch; (6) in a narrower pitch range; (7) in simple falling
                  melodies; and (8) with simple falling nuclei. The conjunction of all these
                  features, then, represents a de facto formula for intonation which identifies a
                  text as "poetic." This fact suggests that the stress-group or metrical foot is not
                  the basic rhythmic unit of verse but rather the "tone-group." Such groups "differ
                  less in pitch, melody, and tone-type, and this makes them more nearly equal events
                  than those in non-poetry. The sequence of units in poetry, therefore, is closer to
                  being a regular recurrence of equal events. . . ." [italics added]. </note>

                  Butler Yeats. The Hague: Mouton, 1973. 135 pp. Based on her dissertation of the
                  same title, DA 27 (1967): 3057A (Catholic University of America). </bibl>
               <note> That no full-scale study of the versification of the greatest poet of this
                  century has yet been undertaken is a humiliation to our profession. Dougherty has
                  given us a pilot study for such a work here: adopting the metrical system of La
                  Drière (E570) she analyzes about 3000 lines of Yeats (25% of his canon) in an
                  attempt to discover and define with some precision the features of his so-called
                  Early, Middle, and Late styles of poetry. Her book consists of sixty pages of
                  prose followed by scansions and charts. Conclusions: (1) "the poems in general are
                  properly described as metrical, and the smallest constitutive unit of the metrical
                  structure as an iamb"; (2) the most significant feature of Yeats's prosody is "the
                  distinct character of the verse-line" as a unit; (3) Yeats's late style is most
                  distinctive in its preference for highly nominal lines; and (4) a thorough study
                  of his syntax is needed. Note that Dougherty uses the troublesome term "rhythm"
                  quite deliberately, on the grounds that "it is the way in which a poet arranges
                  his rhythms (in which meter may or may not inhere) that constitutes his rhythmic
                  style, constitutes, therefore, what may be called in short his prosody. In a total
                  analysis it is the 'coincidence' . . . rather than the separateness of the domains
                  of meter and rhythm that must concern the student of rhythmic structure in Yeats's
                  verse." </note>

                  also the stinging criticism of method by Le Page (D316). Draper's book is the
                  culmination of long study on the timing of the oral delivery of the lines in
                  Shakespeare's plays, faster, slower, or even, as we can glean such knowledge from
                  the evidence of spellings, metrical elisions, awkward clusters of consonants, and
                  the like. We know that Shakespeare worked to vary the speech- tempos and registers
                  and idioms of his various characters since, in part, the Galenic theory of the
                  Humors widely accepted in the Renaissance entailed that various types of
                  personalities would show distinctive celerity or lethargy in speech as well as in
                  action. The book is densely written, with many statistics, tables, and charts
                  covering all the major plays and most of the canon. One is aware, though, that
                  evidence of elision or spelling is equivocal at best; it is nearly impossible to
                  say for certain that at any given line Shakespeare was working for
                  characterization rather than for regular (or irregular) meter (to uphold the
                  latter is no denigration), or that the compositors have not taken liberties.
                  Draper's command of the textual scholarship of Hinman, Greg, and the others also
                  seems insufficient. But that timing-variation as a means to characterization was
                  practiced (and valued) by Shakespeare, no one can deny. One also sees in Draper's
                  work the best example of the debilitating, counterproductive expansion of modern
                  scholarship: his useful book synthesizes the work of a score of now useless
                  periodical publications, which I list below merely for the sake of completeness.
                  This whole method of publication is vicious, swelling our libraries with redundant
                  if not trivial (or worse, in some cases) information. </note>

                  Faure's long Introduction takes account of nearly every conspicuous metrical work
                  of this century up to about 1960. His own theory though is not in the mainstream:
                  he accepts stress as the principal feature of meter but believes that stress is
                  primarily established not by intensity but by pitch; stress is rendered prominent
                  "par les ruptures ou des inflexions MELODIQUES" and English verse-rhythm "est
                  solidaire d'un puissant RYTHME DE TIMBRE." His pitch-accent theory marks five
                  constant tones and seven "melodic" (rising, falling, or complex) tones in the
                  melodic contour of the line, the tonal unit being the syllable not the single
                  phoneme. The book is almost exactly divided between theory and application.

               <note> The mistake of Foxwell and all the other critics of Wyatt's prosody has been
                  to assume that he intended to write regular meter. MS evidence shows that Wyatt
                  deliberately roughened some lines. Therefore we should assume he did not intend to
                  write in regular meters but rather in "rhythm units" the natural clitic groupings
                  of syllables around a stress. Syntactically these groupings may be characterized
                  as either "pausing rhythms" or "flowing rhythms." Wyatt stands on the edge of a
                  great transition in English verse from the former to the latter; his work shows
                  both. But Harding goes further to suggest the two types of rhythm as two
                  fundamental modes of perception available in verse. Describing these, he thinks,
                  will be more effectual than scanning meters. </note>

               <note>Rev: in Style 12 (1978): 390–91; in PTL 4 (1979): 196–201. In his Clark
                  Lectures for 1971–72, Harding pursues the sensible thesis that rhythm in prose and
                  poetry is based on--built up out of--the rhythm of speech. His method is
                  non-technical, and in fact Harding is not especially interested in the kind of
                  analyses of speech possible in acoustic phonetics or phonology. Rather, his method
                  is simple and direct: he looks, repeatedly and steadily, at examples, asking how
                  they work, how they are deployed, rhythmically, how they may be adapted to meter.
                  Sometimes the natural rhythm (stress pattern) and the meter match so well that the
                  meter seems nature not art; sometimes the meter will effect subtle alterations in
                  a rhythm for semantic purposes; other times we can see how the meter will resolve
                  for us a choice between two possible rhythms for a phrase, or, if several rhythms
                  are congruent with the meter, how the sense will distinguish the right one. Now,
                  in the account given by traditional prosody, when the speech rhythm varied within
                  a strictly metered verse-line, one of two things happened: if the variation seemed
                  acceptable or inoffensive it was called a permissible variation or substitution;
                  if unacceptable, however, the line was judged unmetrical. This was accounted for
                  by the primitive and questionable procedure of stipulating permissible
                  combinations of "feet," which is a mere mechanical description and by no means an
                  explanation. A better answer would be that metrical lines establish a "metrical
                  set," such that in aberrant lines, one part of the line establishes a clear "set"
                  which the rest of the line does not then bear out. For Harding, when the rhythm
                  and the meter clash, it is the rhythm which takes priority--as the reality--and
                  "the notion that our reading should ever be some kind of 'compromise' between
                  metre and natural speech is indefensible." Such suggestions are provocative, and
                  warrant the full elaboration they could not receive in this context. </note>

               <note> This genteel, at times nearly fanciful, but unjustly forgotten essay contains
                  a germinal idea that if pursued could bear fruit for a decade of scholarship:
                  Herbert suggests, quite simply, that when the words--the meaning-bearing
                  phonemes--are removed from a poem, a completely meaningful and quickly
                  recognizable pattern-- "tune"--remains, the intonational contour of pitches,
                  durations, and intensities. This contour varies considerably in its minutiae from
                  one reader to the next, but some simple experiments will show that the general
                  shape of the contour is astonishingly uniform. And if it is so for many of us,
                  likely it was nearly so for Shakespeare himself. Not since Eduard Sievers has

               <note> Pakosz identifies certain critical misdirections which have hindered study of
                  the role of intonation (pitch, juncture, timing, tone) in English meter. For us
                  "meter" has usually meant "stress," but pitch has been shown to be the single most
                  important cue in the perception of stress, and clearly the very nature of the
                  verse line alters syntactic and intonational contours from what they would
                  otherwise be in prose. Therefore meter includes intonation as well as stress. Good

               <note> An argument that rhythm is the repetition of any element into recognizable
                  patterns, and that restriction of the concept to its metrical sense prevents
                  prosodists from adequately describing non-metrical poems. Then follow chapters on

                  by the performer or audience", and line-length. Thesis: "The prosody of meter,
                  however adequate in the past, must be modified so that it can deal with the poetry
                  of the present and the future as well. By returning meter to its rhythmic origins
                  and suggesting the rhythmic basis of all poetry, a prosody of rhythm can

                  wholesale confusion of both concepts and terms in this book (not to speak of the
                  curious "gestural" scansions), there is a surprising bedrock of orthodox thinking.
                  The single most unorthodox claim, and the central premise of the whole book, is
                  that meter is subordinate to rhythm. The rhythmic phrase not the metrical foot is
                  the ground unit of verse. Scott admits the existence of metering in feet (he is a
                  Stresser; see his fine anatomy of the question-begging of temporalist theories on
                  pp. 49–51, where he reminds us that "a perfectly arranged disposition of counted
                  masses in a sequent order" (Ruskin) is a reality whereas timing is only a
                  necessary fiction, so that "any attention to timing results almost inevitably in a
                  warping of poetry"), but he argues that when all the metrical variations are
                  admitted, what is left of regularity? The rhythmic "undercurrent" is more crucial
                  than the metrical "current" (p. 63). So for Scott verse is to be measured by the
                  rhythmic phrase not the foot, and it is precisely when the rhythmic phrases become
                  ordered (regularized) that rhythmic prose rises into rhythmic verse. The units of
                  rhythm he analyzes as either rhythma or quadrals, the rhythmon taking two forms,
                  the symmetron and the metron. Symmetra are "isolable sentential phrases" having a
                  scansion of "stressed and unstressed syllables to the right and left of a medial
                  point"; metra, in contrast, are units "whose stress patterns show a duplication of
                  some syllabic combination." Quadrals are sentences of four phrases having similar
                  scansions. The reader can see that such idiosyncrasies make this a difficult book
                  to penetrate and absorb, and though it reveals an extensive knowledge of previous
                  scholarship, there is little here that one can take away as both new and valuable.
                  Probably chapter 3 is the most important. See also Farley (D293). </note>

               <note> A quarrel with F. W. Bateson's opinion that the reader of a poem must perceive
                  in advance the meaning of a line so that he can know how to assign the line its
                  proper rhythm--i.e., so he can read it aright. Sims notes that both processes
                  occur nearly simultaneously, and to say that proper reading requires prior
                  familiarity with the intonational patterns of the language is to say nothing new
                  at all. Fowler, emphasizing the frequent deviance of poetic syntax, suggests that
                  expectation is much less reliable in poetry than in prose, agreeing with Bateson
                  on the logical precedence of meaning but agreeing with Sims that the process of
                  apprehension is rarely sequential, mechanical, or fragmented. The issue, properly
                  in the domain of psycholinguistics, is a crucial one in poetic theory. </note>

                  caesurae and line-ends seem to also mark ends of pitch-contours, and the even
                  ictuses in dipodic verse have raised pitch. We need a thorough study of the
                  conditions under which pitch (or juncture) can partially or solely signal Ictus in
                  English verse. Cf. Crystal (E20). </note>

                  844–45. </bibl>
               <note> The author asserts that in rhythm one may find tunes and tones (as in music),
                  though in poetry the tuneless rhythm is the most highly developed. Still, one can
                  sometimes hear "tune-rhythms" in verse; I take these to be stress-patterns, since
                  all his examples are stress-verse and nursery rhymes and since he distinguishes
                  "tune" from "melody." Rhythm is said to be based on meter as flesh on skeleton.

               <note> The author urges on us his view that verse-structure depends on
                  verse-recitation and that acoustic phenomena depend on indispensable psychic
                  factors. Laboratory experiments disclose one other matter of interest, "the
                  presence in the [verse] line of at least two rises in pitch, spaced at a certain
                  distance," suggesting that it is "the melody rather than the sound intensity"
                  which is crucial to the perception of rhythm. </note>

               <note> Without being very helpfully precise, yet while rounding out the context, the

                  "the fundamental emotional energy of human nature." See also: B218, D179, E606,
