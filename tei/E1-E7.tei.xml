      (1935): 263-65; in English Studies 18 (1936): 95-96. A correlate study to Fussell (E34), less
      urbane but more orderly and us- able and absolutely impartial. Barkas gives a history of what
      was surely the most contentious and confusing--and probably the most important--period in the
      history of versification by explicating separately the theory advanced by every major worker
      in the field from 1880-1930--i.e., Mayor, Bridges, Young, Aber- crombie, Hamer, Lanier, Alden,
      Omond, Saintsbury, Smith, Andersen, Stew- art, Sonnenschein, Bayfield, Thomson, Wilson, and
      Scott. Each short review, generally three to four pages, is succinct yet informative.
      Throughout the book, Barkas distinguishes carefully between Prosody [i.e. Meter] and Rhythmic
      [Rhythm], though the remainder of his terminology is still much too elaborate, imprecise, and
      cumbrous even after his best efforts to codify (see pp. 12-17). The same can be said for the
      more important typology of metrical theories sketched on pp. 7-11 and extended in the last
      chapter (pp. 86-100); it wants Occam's razor. Barkas distinguishes six types of theory, two of
      the them having subtypes (the non-Temporal, three, and the Temporal, five). He also distin-
      guishes, elaborately (see p. 90) between metrical pattern and actualization, which he calls
      respectively Rule Verse and Base Verse: "In Rule Verse what- ever the Metrical Rule prescribes
      is objectively present in the verse-pattern, but in Base Verse the elementary unit of the base
      need not always be objectively present." In sum, though his classifications multiply
      distinctions needlessly, Barkas's synopses of the theories of the eighteen metrists are full,
      fair, and use- ful. </note>

      and New York: E. P Dutton, 1906; ed. George Watson, 1965, 1971. </bibl>
     <note>Coleridge's reply to Wordsworth's Preface (E100) begins at chapter 14, discussing the
      "superadded charm of metre" passim; chapter 18 is the crucial discussion, however. I hazard
      lengthy quotation, given the importance and breadth of the subjects Coleridge raises. Since "a
      poem contains the same elements as a prose composition, the difference therefore must consist
      in a different combination of them, in conse- quence of a different object proposed. . . . it
      is possible that the object may be merely to facilitate the recollection of any given facts or
      observations by artifi- cial arrangement, and the composition will be a poem, merely because
      it is dis- tinguished by metre, or by rhyme, or by both conjointly." But these constitute mere
      "superficial form," and of course many works achieve their objects of truth or pleasure which
      are not in meter, e.g. novels. "Would then the mere superaddition of metre, with or without
      rhyme, entitle these to the name of poems? The answer is that nothing can permanently please
      which does not contain in itself the reason why it is so, and not otherwise. If metre be
      super- added, all other parts must be made consonant with it. They must be such as to justify
      the perpetual and distinct attention to each part which an exact corre- spondent recurrence of
      accent and sound are calculated to excite." This is the familiar argument of "organic form."
      Yet Coleridge allows that "poetry of the highest kind can exist without metre" (the argument
      runs on a distinction be- tween verse and poetry that is operative without being consciously
      articulated). Denying absolutely that "between the language of prose and that of metrical
      composition there neither is, nor can be any essential difference," Coleridge ar- gues that
      things not controvertible are not identical. "The true question must be whether there are not
      modes of expression, a construction and an order of sentences, which are in their fit and
      natural place in a serious prose composition but would be disproportionate and heterogeneous
      in metrical poetry; and vice versa, whether in the language of a serious poem there may not be
      an arrange- ment both of words and of sentences and a use and selection of. . . figures of
      speech . . . which would be vicious and alien in correct and manly prose. I contend that in
      both cases the unfitness of each for the place of the other fre- quently will and ought to
      exist." Five arguments for this position are adduced. First, the psychological ba- sis of
      meter lies in "the balance in the mind effected by that spontaneous effort which strives to
      hold in check the workings of passion." That is, "the elements of metre owe their existence to
      a state of increased excitement," but these ele- ments are also "formed into metre
      artificially, by a voluntary act, with the de- sign and for the purpose of blending a delight
      with emotion, so the traces of present volition should throughout the metrical language be
      proportionally dis- cernible." The result is "an interpenetration of passion and of will."
      These emotions will naturally dictate forms not otherwise procurable. Second, the effect of
      meter is "to increase the vivacity and susceptibility both of the general feelings and of the
      attention. This effect it produces by the continued excitement of surprise, and by the quick
      reciprocations of curiosity still gratified and still re-excited." This is the same effect "as
      a medicated atmos- phere, or as wine during animated conversation," or, better yet, "as that
      of yeast, worthless or disagreeable by itself but giving vivacity and spirit to the liq- uor
      with which it is proportionately conbined." "Metre in itself is simply a stimulant to the
      attention, and therefore excites the question: Why is the atten- tion thus to be stimulated? .
      . . . Neither can I conceive any other answer that can be rationally given, short of this: I
      write in metre because I am about to use a language different from that of prose." Both these
      arguments amount to the same thing: meter is indicative, or adumbrative, of a special use of
      language in poetry, both lexically and syntactically (it is this latter especially which seems
      to be in the center of Coleridge's attention). Third, meter functions also as a catalyst or
      fixative. Meter having been associated, time out of mind, with poetry as its proper form,
      without which poetry will commonly be considered deficient, any other material which might be
      combined with meter "must, though it be not itself essentially poetic, have nevertheless some
      property in common with poetry as an intermedium of af- finity, a sort . . . of mordaunt
      between it and the superadded metre" (mordaunt being a chemical applied to fabrics to fix
      their color during dyeing). Fourth (obscure), there is a human instinct for "unity by
      harmonious adjustment." And fifth, the practice of all the best poets confirms: the excite-
      ment and passions aroused by poetry "demand a correspondent difference of language." It will
      be seen through all this that the problem is the insufficiently clari- fied term language.
      Later in the chapter Coleridge rejects the idea that rules could be given for analysis or
      differentiation of, say, the languages of rage and jealousy; necessarily it must all be a
      matter of intuition. (By this point his reac- tion to Wordsworth's claim that meter is the
      sole differentia of prose and poetry has reached the level of near-ferocity.) It is evident
      that in his remarks on me- ter he is concerned as much or more with syntax as with meter
      strictly speak- ing, but his position is important historically for its clear psychological
      basis (one thinks at once of I. A. Richards in the twentieth century): for Coleridge, meter
      both arouses and regulates passionate response. The reader may also wish to consult and E75,

     <note>Regardless of what we may choose to call the meter of a line, whether we view it as in
      either "rising" or "falling" rhythm seems to depend on seven factors: the reader's
      expectations, syllable-structure at the beginning of the line, and at the end, and around the
      caesura, weak endings, phrasal structure, and vocabulary. Creek is groping toward a
      recognition that the "rhythm" of a line is a function of its syntactic and, more importantly,
      morphological structure. Useful statistics here on the proportion of "imabic" to "trochaic"
      disyllables in iambic verse. Cf. Crapsey (E516), Stewart (E331), Atkins (E467), Hascall

     <bibl>"Intonation and Metrical Theory." Transactions of the Philological Society, 1971, pp.
      1-33. </bibl>
     <note> In this very salient reappraisal and prospectus Crystal shows how metrical the- ory over
      the past century moved from confusion (quantity or stress?) to doc- trine (stress) without
      inquiring much further. But "on what grounds, other than Tradition, has stress been singled
      out from the other phonological features of verse [i.e. intonation] and been identified with
      the metre? What experimental evidence is there to justify the priority of stress in this way?
      None has been provided." Yet the arguments supporting stress in meter apply equally well to
      intonation. The recent literature shows that many Continental metrists have already accepted
      an intonational metrics, while Anglo-American metrists seem content with stress metrics. Their
      contentedness is partially a reaction to the older confusions and skirmishes, which lasted far
      too long, but it is also a trib- ute to the enormous influence of the Trager-Smith phonology.
      An intonational metrics will have to reject this analysis, yet it would still retain the
      virtue of se- lectivity (not all intonational features are equally important), and it should
      give greater explanatory adequacy, as in describing free verse. In Crystal's view the
      "fundamental criterion" of such a metric is the line, "the identifying experience [of which]
      is non-segmental, a prosodic contour" [original italics]. Two experi- ments comparing a text
      set as verse and as prose showed that the line is coter- minous with the "tone-unit," that the
      prominences are contrastive by pitch not by loudness, and that more degrees of gradation are
      required in poetry than in prose. The synchronic view of English metrical theory ca. 1971
      given here is valuable, but more valuable still is the glimpse provided of the course of the
      theory over the next several decades. Cf. D322, D337, E608, L1323, and L1341. </note>

      has form, but that it is a convergence of forms, and forms of disparate orders. It is
      coincidence of forms that locks in the poem. . . . For this is the poet's Poetics: prose is
      written in sentences; poetry in sen- tences and lines. It is encoded not only in grammar, but
      also simultaneously in meter, for meter is the principle or set of principles, whatever they
      may be, that determines the line. And as we perceive of each sentence that it is grammatical
      or not, so the repetitive perception that this line is metrical or that it is not, that it
      exemplifies the rules or that it does not, is the metrical experience. It is the ground bass
      of all poetry." </note>

      fact it is not about Whitman, it is about the nature of the line-end in verse. The line-end is
      the "one fixed mark" which enables the reader to distin- guish between verse and prose in
      audition. It can be denoted either by a rhyme-chime or by a pause. Lines having an odd number
      of stresses have an invariable pause, but lines with an even number have none and so naturally
      tend to be enjambed. Larger issue looming in the distance: poetry's two modes, visual and
      aural. </note>

     <note>A valuable review, organized chronologically, reaching from Old English to the present.
      Fussell believes that no one metrical system can account for the entire gamut of English
      poetry, but that three things may at least be said: English verse is accentually based; it
      seems to flow "most pleasantly and naturally" in rising rhythm; and its natural line-length is
      one of "4 or 5 isochronous units." The essay then proceeds by showing the drifts toward either
      pure Accentualism or Syllabism that have taken place at various times in the history of
      English verse, drifts from the central norm of a regulated number of both syllables and
      stresses. (The only faltering in this regard is the statement that Lanier's Musical prosody
      has a theoretical position emphasizing accentualism; obviously, it emphasized timing.)
      "Prosody" in the title is a solecism for "Metrics." </note>

     <note>Fussell's approach to the history writing is (a) thematic and (b) partitive. From the
      various prosodic issues and trends of the century he selects three for exami- nation: views on
      the metrical structure of the line; theory of elision (i.e. sylla- bism perserved thereby);
      and the increasing legitimacy of trisyllabic substitution (i.e. anti-syllabism, or the rise of
      accentualism as the dominant metrical princi- ple). He therefore ignores: the crucial question
      of the definitions and employ- ments of accent vs. quantity; rhyme; the complex relations of
      poetry and music, so important in the age; and the sundering of metrical theory between Timers
      and Stressers early in the century. In short compass, the history of versification in the
      period 1660-1800 is as follows: heavy French influence on English letters after the
      Restoration resulted in the complete establishment of Syllabism (sylla- ble-counting) as the
      chief principle of meter; Bysshe is the central figure here (1702 etc.). At the same time, by
      a process that (pace Fussell) is still not well understood either theoretically or
      historically, counting-of-syllables led inevita- bly to regularity (regular alternation) of
      stresses. These principles dominate the- ory until about 1740 and remain visible up to about
      1770; thereafter, the story is one of Accentualist insurgency, leading to (the French
      Revolution and) Ro- manticism. Over the century there is also a concomitant diremption in the
      view of prosodists as to whether Quantity, Time, or Accent is the basis of verse. This area is
      far more complex than Fussell allows. Altogether his study makes a series of compromises
      between a full history of versification theory in the century and a full account of the
      positions of the major theorists, who sometimes receive short shrift when their views are
      fragmented among Fussell's thematic divisions. Omond's method (A5) is less artful but more
      cogent: there we find a fuller assessment of the contribution of each theorist to the develop-
      ing understanding of the century. See also the criticisms in Kumbier (E1009). </note>

      the (a) prosodic theories or comments and (b) prosodic practices in the verse printed in the
      prominent American literary journals of the Nineties, placing both of these within the wider
      perspectives of both prosodic theory and practice in America, and also in England, in the
      nineteenth century. Out of the enormous mass of verse he examined (as cited), he scrutinizes
      more closely the work of eight prominent young poets (none of which ever rose into the first
      rank); nearly all of it is metrically very conventional. In the area of theory, the decade was
      still spinning out the ideas of Poe, Lanier, and perhaps Whitman; essays by the would-be
      literari were legion, of course, though Alden and others were pursuing the quiet ends of
      scholarship, while Bolton, for the scientists, looked into the mechanics of rhythm. Perhaps
      the principle issue of the day was the legitimacy of off-rhyme. Whoever writes the successor
      to Allen's American Prosody will find source-material here. </note>

      phonetic autonomy and a principle of semantic cooperation." Of the former, the level of
      background texture, Ransom is simply wrong to thing the meter a mere correlative or superadded

      of ambienceor, at the very least, order. Of the latter: meter can (1) serve as expository
      function, rein- forcing lexical sense; (2) "modulate and define emotion" in its emotive func-
      tion; or (3) reassure or else surprise the reader, in its affective function. </note>

      supplemented by more recent, specialized studies, Ing's book re- mains a classic still to be
      consulted. The general plan is to anatomize Elizabe- than theories of meter and then compare
      these to the actual productions in verse--the lyrics--which were nearly always meant to be
      sung as madrigals and airs. Chapter 2 provides an extremely convenient synopsis of the
      theorists re- printed in Smith's Elizabethan Critical Essays (A26). Chapter 3 gives a
      similarly valuable Glossary of prosodic terms; the usage of such terms in the Renaissance was
      often ambiguous, inconsistent, and indiosyncratic, yet discriminations are crucial, and the
      terms are delicately unravelled. (Cf. these two chapters to E57 and E228.) Chapter 4 examines
      the "visual thing" of pattern poems and also the theories about quantitative verse (cf.
      Attridge, E112); chapter 5 confronts the central metrical phenomonon of the age, verse set to
      music. Chapter 7 explores the role of the three prosodic aspects of speech-- pitch, stress,
      and duration--in Elizabethan lyrics in considerable detail; p. 200 ff discusses the role of
      stress in meter. Remaining chapters focus on the lyrics of Campion, Spenser, Shakespeare, and
      Donne. The book must be set alongside Thompson's (E91), since the latter stops with Sidney,
      while Ing, beginning with Tottel, surveys 1557-1633. More elegantly informed in its style and
      more synoptic in its erudition than Fussell (E34), Ing's work may be our best period study.

     <note>The question of "the mnemonic value of meters," intriguing in itself, yet leads to the
      even-deeper question of the effects of meter: Justice points to "the various combining and
      intersecting functions" of metering, remembering, control, and understanding in the poetic
      craft. In contrast to some others, his own view is that "the meters move along in their own
      domain, scarcely intersecting the domain of meaning, except in some illusory fashion or by
      virtue of conventions nearly private. The responsibility they bear to the sense, comic writing
      aside, is mostly not to interfere." That is, in themselves they are little, as Coleridge said,
      but their effect superimposedon powerful sense is more powerful still. "The twin illusions of
      control and understanding seem more valuable to me than this illu- sion of the real or the
      natural [i.e. mimetic meters]. Yet he can admit that "the meters seem always faintly
      teleological by im- plication. . . . they seem to propose that an emotion, however
      uncontrollable it may have appeared originally, was not, in fact, unmanageable." (Cf. Malof,
      E582.) And "the meters serve as a neutral and impersonal check on self-indul- gence and
      whimsy; a subjective event gets made over into something more like an object." Even memory is
      an "act not without craft," we know, and the me- tering of our verbalizing of our experience
      we want to know much more about. </note>

     <note>A general theory of poetic structure (expressed in very concise form) based on the key
      feature of recurrence; the three modes of analysis identified are Topical, Metrical, and
      Stylistic. In Metrics, recurrence may be either Phonetic, Syntac- tic, or Semantic (English
      verse has heavily exploited the first of these, but who has demonstrated a metering of
      "sememes"?) or a combination of them (i.e. phonetic + syntactic rather than phonetic +
      phonetic). Koch then examines the relationships of metrical constituents ("immediate
      juxtaposition, recurrent in- terval, non-recurrent interval"), patterns of such relationships
      ("contiguous overlapping, congruent, engrafted"), and the principles of metrical "piling,"
      "imposition," and "saturation." Altogether the merit of this brief monograph is to demonstrate
      afresh the possibiities for complexity in meter and (even further) in poetry. See also: Hans

     <note>A remarkable general survey, sustained at a level very near the purely theoreti- cal.
      Prosody is defined as the study of "the elements and structures involved in the rhythmic or
      dynamic aspect of speech . . . as they occur in speech and lan- guage generally (linguistic
      prosody) or in the compositions of the literary arts (lit- erary prosody)" (italics original).
      This latter area has been more often termed ver- sification. Descriptive prosody may be either
      theoretical or historical, while evalua- tive work lies in the domain of criticism. The rhythm
      of verse is one manifesta- tion of rhythmic activity in general, and as a species is more
      closely related to the rhythms of dance--bodily movement--than to those of music, since the
      speech-mechanism itself is a motor behavior. Yet, "it is the sound as heard, the perceptual
      'phone' or 'allophone' rather than the phoneme as such, that is rele- vant for literary, as
      distinct from linguistic, structure of sound." All verse- rhythm is a patterning of the
      qualitative and quantitative features of sound, chiefly intensity or duration: La Dri|`ere
      gives a very extensive theoretical ac- count of the systematic possibilities of such
      patterning. Worthy of special note: "the datum of a prosodic analysis is ideally an oral
      performance (actual or con- ceived) rather than a written text." </note>

     <note>The modern sensibility is so glaringly inept at recognizing and discussing poetic meter
      primarily because no adequate system of scansion is currently taught or understood. Scansion
      is not a theoretical construct but simply a "practical lan- guage of description," and the
      best notation is the one which provides the most accurate, concise, yet flexible description
      of the interplay between rhythm and meter. To deride scansion as "artificial" is to
      misunderstand its very nature. There is no one right scansion, all others being wrong; there
      are only better and worse scansions. </note>

     <note>Since one of the linchpins of Wordsworth's poetics in the 1800 and 1802 ver- sions of the
      Preface is his view of poetry as "the natural language of men," his simultaneous insistence on
      the preservation of meter in poetry would seem in- consistent. WW's defense rests on three
      conceptions of the function of meter: pleasure, regularity, and contrast. Meter per se gives
      pleasure as an ornament to language already efficacious. The regularity of meter tempers and
      restrains the excitement raised by the poetic fiction, as well as reminding the reader,
      implic- itly, that he is experiencing literature not life. And meter balances or contrasts the
      real language of men. Owen notes the evident discrepancy in WW's theo- ries and his practice,
      also admitting that "the prose parts of Wordsworth's blank verse, especially, appear to gain
      no advantage from being in metre." </note>

     <note>By close explication of the statements and arguments made by Wordsworth (in the Preface)
      and Coleridge (in BL) on meter, Parrish controverts the received critical opinion that
      Wordsworth denigrated meter as adventitious while Coleridge defended it as indispensable to
      the organic whole, the poem. That is the view Coleridge would have us believe. But in fact,
      though Wordsworth did argue that meter has no necessary connection with language,he held it to
      be essential for effecting the tranquility that is poetic pleasure, while for Coleridge meter
      was a stimulant and a matter of "superficial form," separable from the language that was
      central. Indeed to Coleridge meter was a symbol of a special- ized poetic language--precisely
      the view Wordsworth attacks in the "Preface." Wordsworth, focusing on the function of art,
      treats the role of meter in aesthetic response; Coleridge, focusing on the sources of art,
      treats the role of meter in the creative process. </note>

     <note>From 1480 to 1590 the verseform of English drama developed from the rhyme- royal and
      tail-rhyme stanzas (in four-stress lines) through the "septenary" cou- plet (the Fourteener)
      to the decasyllable (rhymed and blank) and prose. But "the attempt to find pentameters,
      alexandrines, or septenaries, even of an im- perfect kind, in [the dramas of the first half of
      the sixteenth century] reduces their versification to chaos." The old order was completely
      upset by "the most important innovation in versification of the century," the introduction of
      regu- lar meters (regular in syllable-count), the earliest example of which in the drama is
      Jasper Heywood's Senecan Troas of 1559. Blank verse, of course, first appeared in Gorboduc,
      1562. See esp. p. 188 here, and see also K307. The final paragraph summarizes succinctly "the
      residuum of a hundred years of experimentation" in dramatic verseform, specifically the four
      metrical styles employed by the dramatists of the day to differentiate the Virtue and Vice
      characters and high social stations from low. Highly informative, Ramsay's essay is still
      authoritative, and its lucid map- ping of a bewildering terrain is augmented by frequent,
      detailed metrical analyses of plays. </note>

     <note>Richards takes what might be called a Gestalt (i.e., perceptional-field) approach to

      separated from the effects of other contextual elements; sound in itself has no meaning. The
      sound of a word cannot be considered apart from its meaning. The interaction of succession and
      simultaneity comprises rhythm. Meter, as "a specialized form of rhythm," is not a patterned
      stimulus but a pat- tered response, as well as being a "framing device" (cf. Hollander, E46).

      b), there are four possibilities: (1) a and b have identical placements in the meter--such
      diaeresis tends to make the meter glare, and Richardson calls it "unmusical" in contrast to
      the other three types; (2) a and b may vary slightly in word-form (lover, loved, etc.) but be
      identically metrically treated; (3) a and b fall in different metrical positions (now arsis,
      now thesis) though identical in word-form; and (4) a and b differ both in metrical and in

     <note>Rev. in Poetry 72 (1948): 332-35. Shapiro finds two historical trends to lament: one is

      nineteenth century; the other is that after the turn of the century and "one of the few great
      upheavals" in English poetry--free verse--prosody was thrown again into anarchy, from which it
      has not yet recovered. Shapiro then sketches in cameo the theoretical positions of the two
      chief schools of prosody, the Accentualists (Saintsbury and Bridges) and Temporalists
      (Lanier), with Omond in a medial position. These correspond roughly to the two broadest
      traditions in English verse, the stress-verse (Beowulf to Skelton to Hopkins) and the
      stress-verse (Chaucer to Housman). But the nineteenth-century prosodic synthesis was unable to
      cope with the new prosaic structures and rhythms in verse. </note>

      Shapiro attempts to map out the theorists and practitioners of his time in a prosaic verse, as
      if the Essay on Criticism were rewritten as The Prelude Of the theorists, Bridges on Milton,
      Lanier on verse, and Saintsbury on prose-rhythm are discussed; of the cloistered makers, Joyce
      and Eliot are assayed the great masters of our time (both indebted to Pound), as against the
      more ephemeral, weaker metrics of Donne, Browning, Hopkins, Whitman, Cummings, Lawrence,
      Williams, and the Imagist, Visual, and Objectivist prosodies. Strong stressing is hammering
      down the old "rising rhythm," and Shapiro ventures his hypothesis that "rhythm/Flows but in
      one direction, and that from Prose/To rime. The oppo- site is upstream, against/The grain of
      language and the course of change./ The measure of prosody is the current speech,/The cadences

      sense and mood of satire. This "harshness" lay not in syllable-count (here they are all
      relatively regular) but in preserving regularity of stresses. Roughness was also associated
      with "masculinity." The virtuosity of the meta- physicals in stanza-forms is also adduced as

      on Renaissance metrics and, indeed, on the more general subject of the nature of English
      accentual-syllabic meter in its sta- ple form, the iambic pentameter line. Beginning with a
      rigorous distinction between the natural (rhythmic) stresses of the language and the abstract
      metrical pattern, and adopting the two axioms entailed by this distinction--that verse can be
      read one way and scanned another, and that the effect of counterpoising rhythm against meter
      is to create tension [this is the hallmark of the structural approach]--Thompson traces out
      carefully the development of the pentameter line in early Renaissance verse, from the
      domination of natural speech rhythms in Wyatt through the other extreme of excessive metrical
      regularity in Surrey to the synthesis of both of these styles in the supple, finely modulated
      metrical instrument of Sidney, the meter which will be the standard of English poetry for
      three centuries thereafter. But equally remarkable is Thompson's argument that "the iambic
      metrical pattern has dominated English verse because it pro- vides the best symbolic model of
      our language"--that is, through meter "what poetry imitates is the structure of the language
      itself." Meter crystallizes (by se- lection, reduction, and abstraction) the deep structure of
      the language. Chapters: on Wyatt, Tottel, and Surrey; The Mirror for Magistrates; Googe,

     <bibl>"Articulateness and Requiredness in Iambic Verse." Style 6 (1972): 123-48. </bibl>
     <note>The relationship of grammatical to prosodic features ("strings") in verse may be either
      convergent or divergent, states which differ markedly in "perceptual quality" or texture;
      divergence produces either soft focus (Milton, Shelley) where the two kinds of features
      gradually fade into each other, or split focus (Pope), where they are polarized.
      Articulateness and requiredness, antinomies, two sides of the same coin, are the two aspects
      of "breaking up a whole into segments." Ar- ticulateness implies segmentation of a whole into
      parts both "distinct" and "jointed" in order to simplify its perception. Requiredness implies
      the integrity of the whole through its parts: no part is superfluous. In general the more
      highly articulated a structure is, the more highly required are its parts, though not always.
      Split Focus: Clearly one of if not the chief function of verse-structure is to heighten the
      "visibility" of the segmentation, i.e. of the small-scale units. When grammatical and metrical
      units are not convergent, they "compete" with each other for our attention. The first of the
      two versions of the couplet below seems wittier to us--sharper in bite, stronger in
      pull--because "awake" (first version) is more highly required by the positioning of the
      syntactic break late in the line: Now Lapdogs give themselves the rowzing Shake, And sleepless
      Lovers, just at Twelve, awake. Now Lapdogs give themselves the rowzing Shake, And, just at
      Twelve, the sleepless Lovers awake. From this example and others we can see however that
      position is by no means the only factor in establishing tension--meter, narratorial voice, and
      many other factors pertain. Among the major English poets, Browning is by far the most
      vigorous at sustaining split focus; his verse has a very evident sharpness and a "conclusive"
      tone. Soft Focus: More extreme pressures and more complex structures pro- duce a melding of
      polarity into continuity and a "suspensive" tone, as in Wordsworth, Shelley, and Milton. A
      high frequency of syntactic breaks near the ends of the line normally produces split focus,
      but after sufficient reiteration will slide over into the blurred, multi-layered texture so
      common in Milton. Similarly the strong requiredness generated by enjambment produced fluidity
      by weakening the line-end. Stress-shifts and complex syntax may achieve the same effects. An
      important new approach to the description of verse-structure; see also Tsur's monography
      (E810), of which this article is anything but a mere redaction. </note>

     <note>In the fifth paragraph Wordsworth commences upon the creation of his proper audience by
      warning his readers against any expectation of (what later came to be called) the "metrical
      contract"--reader presuppositions about the style and themes of poems set in a certain meter.
      His larger problem is to explain his paradoxical view that the "language" of poetry is
      identical to the language of prose, the "real language of men." Part of his strategy for a
      solution is to map out a rough theory of meter, defending meter as a source of "charm" and
      "pleasure" which may be beneficially superadded to the effects of prose, sense and order. The
      pleasure inhering in the regularity of meter will function as a mild narcotic, soothing the
      reader whenever the sheer excitement of good po- etry tends to overwhelm his emotions, and
      reminding him subliminally that what he is experiencing is art not reality. Thus the meter,
      emblem of "simili- tude in dissimilitude," produces "a complex feeling of delight." And what
      Wordsworth terms "the tendency of meter to divest language in a certain de- gree of its
      reality" will later be called "aesthetic distance." See Coleridge's reply at E13, and see E70

      meters that have developed with the language. . . . If I wrote of personal love or sor- row in

      London: Longman Group, 1973. pp. 6-13. The study of verse-structure is a proper domain of
      phonetics "because verse is verse as a result of the way certain aspects of sound, or rather
      perhaps the sound-producing movements, of speech have been exploited or organized." The
      air-stream produced in speech is not continuous but pulsatory in two di- mensions: the regular
      muscular contractions creating pressure peaks, here termed chest-pulses (each of which
      corresponds to one syllable), and also the "less frequent, more powerful contractions of the
      breathing muscles which every now and then coincide with, and reinforce, a chest-pulse
      stress-pulses." Languages which organize the latter are stress-timed, those organizing the
      for- mer, syllable-timed. English verse, not different in kind from English speech, is
      stress-timed (stress-pulses may occur even in the absence of a sounded syllable), divided into
      isochronous stress-initiating units called feet, and "must be there- fore in some sense
      quantitative." Silent stresses are unexpectedly common, English verse has many more types of
      feet than Greek, and line-end is usually signaled by a silent stress, monosyllabic foot, or
      the rhyme. Notice the sample scansions, whch seem especially forced and unnatural. </note>

      adjacent syl- lables and varies with context, in contrast to Greek, where syllabic quantity
      was absolute and constant. N.B.: syllable-quantity does not equal vowel quantity. A.
      postulates that English utterances are divided into isochronous stress-timed feet, such that
      "we cannot therefore sway anything about the quantity of a sylla- ble until we know its place

      or the absolute association of emotions with word-sounds--a complex but precise system of
      correspondences Pound held to be different for each language. Hence, Adams shows, he often
      subordinated lexical and seman- tic accuracy in his translations to melopoeic accuracy. By the
      former, Pound meant a rigorous system of verse-composition based on quantity, but lacking any
      consistency of principle: "Pound's syllable may be long either by nature, or by position, or
      by stress, but sometimes a stressed syllable is insisted on as short and counterpointed.
      Pound's principles are thus arbitrary and contradictory. . . . This is not to say that Pound's

      Press, 1960. See also Omond (E214), Spedding (E238), Munro (M140), Newman (E210), and Lord
      Redesdale (E220). On the criticial question of audience, Arnold considers the best reader and
      judge of a Homeric translation to be the scholar, both fluent in the original Greek and
      possessed of genuine taste in poetry. And though the lectures treat mainly of style and
      movement, the third of the original three turns to the ques- tion of meter, Arnold rejecting
      couplets (Chapman's and Pope's), blank verse (Cowper's Miltonic convolutions) and ballad meter
      (Francis W. Newman's), preferring instead the hexameter (Hawtrey's are approved, Clough's and
      Long- fellow's rejected) as being the closest to the original Homeric "movement" (a crucial
      term). The stiffness of the dactyls in the English hexameter may be avoided by frequent
      spondees; the only other requirement (also crucial) is that the lines must "read
      themselves"--i.e. the natural accent should not be wrenched unnaturally to fit the metrical
      pattern. The lines must read naturally to the Eng- lish ear, though at the same time the
      quantities must not be "utterly discarded." In the Last Words lecture (delivered November 30,
      1861), Arnold makes a sincere effort to mollify Newman (whose Reply to Arnold's earlier
      criticisms in the second lecture showed him eager to avenge an inflated sense of injury) while
      at the same time defending his original judgments, then examines the views of Spedding
      (English hexameters should be quantitative) and Munro (quantity should be entirely ignored)
      with surprising energy, generally siding with Munro in favor of the accentual imitation as
      something "necessary and in- evitable" to the English ear. "We must work with the tools we
      have." The lecture concludes with the memorable soft eulogy for Clough. See also the untitled

      Near the end of Book II, Ascham criticises his contemporary verse-writers, those "rash,
      ignorant heads, which now can easily reckon up fourteen syllables, and easily stumble on every
      rhyme" but are too idle and ignorant to labor for complete perfection of verse, "true quantity
      in every foot and syllable." Rhyme too earns his scorn: "our rude beggarly rhyming [was]
      brought first into Italy by Goths and Huns, when all good verses and all good learning too
      were de- stroyed by them. . . . to follow rather the Goths in rhyming, than the Greeks in true
      versifying, is even to eat acorns with swine, when we may freely eat wheat bread among men."
      Surrey and Periz are noticed as laudable poets who avoid rhyme and "observe just number and
      even feet" but their feet are unfortunately "feet without joints, that is to say not distinct
      by true quantities of syllables." Thus, the first important English commentator on
      verse-structure mis- understands the native accentual meter entirely, and so damns it for
      being too formless and easy, requiring neither labor nor learning. See also E40. As for the
      earliest English verse written in quantitative meters, there are some specimens in Ascham's
      Toxophilus (a popular treatise on archery) of 1545, and in Book I of The Scholemaster Ascham
      quotes verses by Thomas Watson (Bishop of Lincoln) from his unpublished translation of the
      Odyssey (ca. 1545). The interest in England in setting modern verse to classical meters seems
      to have been transmitted through Jacques de la Taille in France from Claudio Tolemei in Italy
      (1539). For further discussion of Ascham see: </note>

      at Cambridge University in 1971. Rev.: in MP 76 (1978): 69-73; in English 24 (1975): 91-92.
      Attridge is now the standard reference on the subject of quantitative experi- ments in the
      Renaissance. The book contains three parts: parts 2 and 3 review the theorizing and the verses
      of poets, first synthetically (in 2), exam-ining the Renaissance attitudes toward both
      vernacular verse and classical imitators, the origin and extent of the vogue for quantitative
      verse, and the nature of the verse itself, then analytically by author (in 3), with separate
      examinations of each of the major theorists and poets. But more important is the more
      abstract- -but more crucial--analysis in part 1, not hitherto researched fully or directly, of
      the exceedingly complex question, "What is quantity?" This question resolves itself at once
      into three others, scarcely easier--"What is the modern under- standing of Latin verse?" "How
      did the Renaissance understand Latin verse?" and "How did the Romans understand Latin verse?"
      Everyone speaks glibly of longs and shorts, but as Attridge convincingly shows, the phonetic
      evidence is far too complex and ambiguous for the simplistic, text-book definition of quantity
      to be correct. It would seem, judging from Renais-sance primers for schoolboys, that the
      Renaissance approach, at least, was not to stress (in pro- nunciation of Latin verses) the
      ictuses (i.e. the "long" syllables" but rather the syllables which would be stressed according
      to normal English rules of accen- tuation. Such a "prosaic" stressing, rather than an ictic
      stressing, would effectu- ally polarize the normal accentual system from the more abstract and
      artificial "quantities," which were determined by a complex system of rules (not really very
      intelligible, even to them, but accepted on authority), among which was one which allowed
      determination of quantity by orthography (i.e. by varying the spelling of a word one could
      produce a desired quantity). Thus we can see how abstract and visual rather than aural was the
      whole Renaissance understanding of Latin verses, and also how sophisticated and antithetical
      it seemed in the face of vernacular poetry. It is this demonstration of the crucial role of
      phrase-stressing and orthography (taught to the Elizabethan schoolboy as he scanned his Latin
      verses) that Attridge is able to achieve an altogether remarkable synthesis of some very
      confusing evidence into that most difficult of all historicial results, a coherent,
      convincing, and "natural" account of what the problem looked like through the eyes of the men
      of the time. E113 Related: Percy Simpson, "The Elizabethan Pronunciation of Accented Greek

     <note>A thesis Baker can uphold because he believes that stress "is the only cause of"
      quantity, or that quantity "more or less rides along with stress" nearly always. [This has yet
      to be proven.] "In Latin, syllables are long by intrinsic nature or position, and they stay in
      position. In English, stress alone makes quantity, and what one minute you think is stressed
      may not be the next time you look." [This is question-begging.]Baker identifies two types of
      short syllables in Eng- lish (time-values 1/4 and 1/2) and three types of longs (1, 3/4, and
      1- 1/4). </note>

     <note>Written perhaps as early as 1591, by its publication date Campion's treatise had become
      simply an index of what concessions the faltering theory of classical- imitative verse in
      English was driven to in order to have any credence at all. In the First Book of Ayres in 1601
      Campion had declined the use of quantitative meters in favor of "ear-pleasing rimes," and when
      he came to a full-scale de- fense of the classical forms the following year, his position was
      mixed at best: he bases quantity directly on accent ("above all the accent of our words is
      dilli- gently to be observed, for chiefly by the accent in any language the true value of the
      syllables is to be measured"), though "accent," being described as rising, falling, grave, or
      flat, seems to be not only stress but pitch. Yet at the same time he allows length by
      position, which does in fact wrench accent. Fortunately, though, he scans by ear
      (phonetically) rather than by eye, allowing no clumsy machinery of orthography. The bulk of
      the Observations presents the eight measures (iambic, dimeter, trochaic, elegaic, three types
      of lyric, and ana- creonic) which English could improve itself by adoption. But the most
      interest- ing matter is that Campion's close training in music leads him to treat verse-
      structure (quantity) in terms of Time. Anyone who can "time a song" can see that Latin and
      English pentameters "are in nature all of the same length of sound . . . for either of them
      being timed with the hand, quinque perficiunt tem- pora, they fill up the quantity (as it
      were) of five semibreves." Metrical rests are allowed in verse as in music, and the failing of
      pyrrhic substitutions in iambic lines lies in their "curtailing their verse." Number in
      poetry, too, refers not only to the number of syllables but also to "the length or shortness
      of their sound" as is the case when verse is set to music. Omond (A5) misses this crucial
      matter entirely, as well as one other: in his chapter 4 Campion reveals what is demon- strably
      a clear understanding of trochaic and trisyllabic substitutions. But none of these keen
      perceptions did any good: the whole quantitative controversy had been moribund for a decade
      when the Observations was published, and Daniel's reply (E521) was irrefragable. And Campion's
      defense, by revealing the severe weaknesses of his position, served only to advance the case
      of the Accentualists. See N75. </note>

      syllables in English and that "accent in the modern languages is the same thing as quantity in
      the ancient"; indeed, an accentual hexameter is "diametrically opposed to classical usage and
      principle." Yet mod- ern translators of classical verse can never succeed until "they can
      become in posse, if not in esse, exact imitators of both the accentual and quantitative com-
      binations of the ancients." Time and pauses in English verse also mentioned (first page).

      written in imitation of the classical quantitative meter. Also in accentual hexameters are
      Amours de Voyage and the six "Essays in Classi- cal Metres" (two passages from the Iliad, two
      Elegiacs, on Alcaic, and "Ac- taeon"). Add to these an essay, "Illustrations of Latin Lyrical
      Meters," and the "Letters of Parepidemius, Number Two: On Translating Homer" which may be
      located conveniently in the Selected Prose Works edited by Buckner B. Trawick (University of
      Alabama Press, 1964, pp. 66-84,180-86). The latter es- say first appeared in the 1888 edition
      of the Prose Remains. Clough's view is that both accent and quantity are important to both
      classical and modern verse; in classical verse, however, the metrical accent was based on
      pitch, and independent of the ordinary accentuations based on stress-- i.e., "The accent of
      speech was lost in the accent of song." Thus, "with the an- cients the accent of words in
      metre was . . . independent of their colloquial ac- cent: while with us the two are kept
      simply identical. The accent of words with us is fixed, with them was in metre arbitrary. So
      on the other hand, with them, the quantity was fixed and carefully observed;with us it is
      variable, and greatly neglected. Still there can be no question but that discrimination of
      quantity enters largely into the modern art of versifying." To modernize a clas- sical meter,
      then, two rules are necessary: "the Metrical Accent must remain the same" and "Quantity should
      be preserved." Clough cleaves strictly to the first but not the second. In short, he uses the
      modern English stress-accent as ana- logue of the classical Greek pitch-accent to mark the
      metrical ictus. The British reader has no patience, he observes (second letter of
      Parepidemius), for so so- phisticated a treatment as one which might counterpoint or oppose
      the stress and the ictus. </note>

      Orator of long standing at Oxford, Crowe's theoretical position dates from the 1760's: he
      accepts quantity as the basis of verse almost as if it were axiomatic. More curious still,
      "the simplest elements of verse are letters-- of letters are formed syllables--of syllables
      feet--of feet a verse." Yet having been faithful to the letter, he turns to the
      spirit--sounds. The Introduction gives an interesting historical review of the
      prosodists--Webbe, Gascoigne, Putten- ham, Campion, Daniel, Cowley, Woodford, Poole, Bysshe,
      Pemberton, Fos- ter, Mitford, and several other lesser mortals. Of the several "experiments"
      in metric undertaken in English poetry (alliterative, classical-imitative, and four- teener,
      e.g.), only that of "ten syllables, free from rhyme" has succeeded. From this we can see that
      Crowe takes decasyllabism as an absolute. In its time, his book was the voice of things past.

      the "quantities" were thought to be derived originally from actual time-values. Dryden's

     <note>The double exchange between "Immerito" (Spenser) and Harvey is perhaps the central
      surviving text of the whole quantitative movement, since it is our source for the differing
      opinions of Drant, Spenser, and especially Harvey, who seems to have been the prime mover
      behind it all. Spencer was himself mainly unmoved. It used to be thought that these three
      writers formed a literary coterie, the Areopagus (see p. 89 in Smith and accompanying Notes),
      but the evidence is tenuous and the opinion is not much promoted anymore. I follow Smith's
      ordering of the letters below. In the first letter, Spenser acknowledges that Sidney and Dyer
      have "prescribed certaine Laws and rules of Quantities of English sillables for English verse"
      and "drawen mee to their faction"; indeed, "I am, of late, more in loue wyth my Englishe
      Versifying than with Ryming." He chides Harvey for "a breache in Maister Drant's Rules" and
      provides a sample of quantitative lines, the "Iambicum Trimetrum," which Harvey then chides in
      return, in the second letter, with wit and energy turning serious, as not being precisely
      perfect (though he admits knowing nothing of Drant's rules). Spenser in the short third letter
      asks for a copy of Harvey's rules and offers to send Drant's as annotated by both Sidney and
      himself; he also opines that the English Hexameter "will easily and fairly yeelde it selfe to
      oure Mother tongue. For the onely or chiefest hard- nesse, whych seemeth, is in the Accente;
      whych sometime gapeth, and as it were yawneth illfauouredly, comming shorte of that it should,
      and sometime exceeding the measure of the Number, as in Carpenter the middle sillable, be- ing
      vsed shorte in speache, when it shall be read long in Verse, seemeth like a lame Gosling that
      draweth one legge after hir. . . ." His following question is significant for implying a sharp
      distinction between (accentual) reading and (quantitative) scansion of the orthographic line:
      "for why, a Gods name, may not we, as else the Greekes, haue the kingdome of oure owne
      Language, and measure our Accentes by the sounde, reseruing the Quantitie to the Verse?" It is
      in the fourth letter then that Harvey comes to give examples of his own practice and to
      quarrel about theory. His view in a nutshell: "the Latine is no rule for us. . . .Position
      neither maketh shorte nor long in oure Tongue."English orthograpyy is far too fickle to serve
      as the basis of a visual versification: only pronunciation will serve: "it is not either
      Position, or Diph- thong, or Diastole, or anye like Grammer Schoole Deuice that doeth or can
      indeede either makelong or short, or encrease, or diminish the number of Silla- bles, but
      onely the common allowed or receiued PROSODYE. . . . you shall neuer haue my subscription or
      consent (though you should charge me wyth the authoritie of fiue hundreth Maister DRANTS) to
      make your Carpenter, our Carpenter, an inch longer or bigger than God and his Englishe people
      haue made him." All this may amount to no more than saying that the quantity of an English
      syllable does not entail an accent, or vice versa; if so, Drant and Sidney thought precisely
      the same. Harvey does not dispel Spenser's confusion on this point. And his purpose throughout
      is to secure the right basis for determining quantity, not to substitute accent for it. Webbe
      observed that Harvey's whole approach was not entirely serious, and clearly the statements
      near the end of the fourth letter are more rhetoric than anything else: they certainly are not
      a clear or careful synopsis of his views. In practice, Harvey scans by quantities, and he even
      admits length by position except for doubled consonants, which he rec- ognizes are not sounded
      so. His verses are more or less passable by accent, but Hendrickson attributes this to the
      arbitrary monosyllabic structure of the lan- guage not to any conscious choice. See also E224,
      E227, and E268. </note>

     <bibl>"Elizabethan Quantitative Hexameters." PQ 28 (1949): 237-60. </bibl>
     <note>The criticism of Elizabethan classical-imitative verse commonly raised by
      prosodists--that its pronunciation is aberrant beyond redemption--is a simple catagory
      mistake: the quantivists never intended to write accentual-analogue hexameters, where the
      natural word-stresses correspond to the quantities and the ictuses. When they read their
      (English quantitative) verses, they read fol- lowing the accents, even as Latin verses
      themselves were read during the Ren- aissance. When they scanned their verses, however, they
      scanned the metrical quantities without regard to accent. This is not a case of "double
      audition" but rather of two separate activities altogether. It is true that the quantities and
      the accents do correspond perfectly in some lines, but this is due not to design but to the
      structure of the language itself; all such lines will be found to be entirely monosyllabic.
      Critics have also misunderstood Harvey. His theoretical statements are confused, and he does
      recognize the impossibility of length by doubled conso- nants in English, but his verses show
      that like the others he accepted length by position. Like them too he scans by quantity but
      pronounces by accent. Stany- hurst even went a little further toward Latin polysyllabicity in
      his verses, but he too conforms. See E240. </note>

     <note>"The difficulty of converting quantitative to accentual meters. . . . is greatly ex-
      aggerated." The Latin shows accentual effects, and quantitative effects cannot be avoided in
      English (examples). The real problems in translation are the great variety of feet in
      classical meters, the dissimilarity of conventional line-lengths, the immense resources of
      word-order denied to English, and the preservation of some modicum of the sound-structure of
      Latin. </note>

     <note>The posthumous treatise of an Australian poet on the possibilities for metering syllabic
      duration in English poetry. Jury observes, sensibly, that stress is the dominant
      characteristic of our language, but that quantity exists as well, and that major English poets
      (e.g. Pope in the Essay on Criticism) have sometimes employed syllable-length very
      successfully in English verse. The poet who wishes to imitate classical verse in English may
      do so in one of five ways: (1) substitution of stress in the (quantitative) metrical patterns,
      ignoring quantity altogether (Clough, Longfellow); (2) occasional foregrounding of quantity in
      accentual verse for sharp effects (Pope); (3) a serious attempt to order quantities in the
      English syllables on the classical model, which yet is willing to yield to the native
      stress-patterns wherever the verse becomes strained (Swinburne)-- Jury terms this verse
      quasi-quantitative; (4) rigorous quantitative meter regardless of stress (Bridges); and (5)
      both a correct quantitative pattern and a natural, correct, and corresponding stress pattern
      (Tennyson). Rules are given for the quantity of English syllables. </note>

      (1902): 5-13,148-49. </bibl>
     <note>Cogently, McKerrow classes "practically all verse that has ever been called clas- sical"
      as (1) verse called quantitative but in fact accentual and nothing else; (2) verse adopting
      the abstract pattern of classical verse but substituting accent for quantity; (3)
      "quantitative" verse in which the quantities are determined by natural English pronunciation;
      or (4) "quantitative verse which adopts, at least in part, the true classical rules, such as
      length by position. In general the devel- opment was from the fourth type to the second.
      McKerrow observes quite correctly that, as for judgments on the whole enterprise, "to accuse
      such men of simple folly were surely a still more simple presumption in ourselves." Given the
      authoritative status of the classics and the wretchedness of vernacular poetry at the time, it
      would be surprising if no classical-imitative verses had been at- tempted. As for quantity,
      the determination of the length of the syllable had- nothing to do with (1) whether or not the
      length of the vowel was noted, (2) pronunciation, or (3) actual duration of time.It was
      entirely conventional; scansion was divorced from pronunciation. Nothing else explains the
      theorists' concern with orthography. McKerrow assays separately the contribution of each of
      the known figures of the movement--Drant, Dyer, Sidney, Harvey (the disparity between his
      theory and practice is noted), Stanyhurst, Webbe, Fraunce, Puttenham, Sabie, Dickinson, the
      anonymous author of The First Booke of the Preservation of King Henry VII, Campion, and
      Sandford [in the sup- plementary note; chronologically he comes first]. A wellspring essay:
      McKer- row's immense bibiographical knowledge enabled him to make many sugges- tions here that
      had never been made previously and even now have not been pursued. See also: </note>

      by-product of the quantitative meter in the Latin. The same stanza-form is used by Collins for

      reading is carried on without regard to anything but the sense of the passage." The second
      essay, written a month later, defends this position against some intervening criticisms.

      (1977): 335-49. </bibl>
     <note>Attempting to ferret out the elusive definition of "quantity"used by the Eliza- bethans
      and also a legitimate rationale they could have held for their poetic practice, Schuman
      examines (1) the "aesthetic assumptions" made by the Eliza- bethan poets, (2) their conception
      of Latin versification, and (3) the principles which they seem to have used in constructing
      their quantitative verses. Her conclusion is that the Elizabethan poets scanned a syllable as
      long or short by two rules, operating sequentially, the first mandatory and the second
      optional: if a syllable was not long by (positional) definition in the Latin system, then it
      might be by accentuation in the English one.That is, the English poets wrote quantitative
      verse which was to be scanned according to the Latin rules but read (stressed) according to
      the regular English pronunciation. The first system was visual, the second aural.
      Astoundingly, the author seems totally unaware of the work of Attridge (E112), but
      nevertheless the article is closely argued and offers a useful com- parison of the work of

     <bibl>"The Metrical Theory and Practice of Thomas Campion." PMLA 59 (1944): 1003-18. </bibl>
     <note>Campion's theory of English meter can be properly appraised only by setting aside
      altogether his interest in music (and musical settings) and by understand- ing his beliefs
      about accent and quantity. Short, claiming [without any further explanation] that English has
      "four classes of syllables" differentiated by stress, pitch, and length, argues (1) that
      Campion was interested not in classical met- rics but in the quantities (and accents) properly
      a part of English meter, when the classical rules are reconciled to the vagaries of English
      pronunciation, and also (2) that Campion sought to write verse having lines comprising equal
      peri- ods of time regardless of their syllabic filling. Such a theory with such a practice
      Short has understandable difficulty reconciling; he therefore argues that the proper
      illustrations of Campion's position in the Observations are not the exam- ples given therein
      but Campion's own poems published the year before in A Book of Ayres. These latter are then

      tween the durations of the several events or groups of events of which the se- quence is
      composed." "My own proposed system of scansion may be described as an attempt to reinstate the
      foot (in the ancient sense of the term) as a unit of measurement." That is, he believes that
      English is exactly like Greek and Latin in that two "short"syllables may stand for one "long"
      and so receive metrical ictus, and also in that accent and quantity are inseparable.Chapter 8
      gives Rules for the Quantity of every English syllable, based on the kymography measurements

      the fifth being always a dactyl and the sixth a tro- chee. In this practice he follows the

     <note>A long, close review of Hendrickson (E175), generally approbatory. Standop reminds us
      that the classical-imitative phenomenon is not restricted to the Renaissance, and that we
      still cannot judge very well the aesthetic (metrical) value of the experiments. The
      Renaissance read such verse with normal prose accents, not with a melodic accent, though
      perhaps both systems were heard simultaneously (Standop). Thus our reading or quantitative
      verse by accent may not be so unrealistic; the Renaissance poets generally avoid congruence of
      ac- cent and ictus, and it may be that counterpointing of stress and ictus is the best
      compromise solution, as we see in the "thin"spondees of Voss with their "free- floating'
      stress. The ultimate question in these matters is whether English sylla- bles are long and
      short; the answer must be No. Conclusion: the nature of quantitative verse arises not from the
      hypothetical pattern but from the real ac- centual pattern, whether intended or not. A
      balanced theory will pay attention to both. </note>

     <note>Praised by Harvey but treated cooly by some others (who were put off both by his language
      and by his uncompromising classicism, probably), Stanyhurst seems to have the strongest effort
      of any of the Renaissance quantivists to ad- here to the Latin metrical system. Not only does
      he follow the quantitative structure of the Latin line strictly, he also adheres to the
      accentual structure of its last two feet, and he even conforms to the morphological structure
      of the meter as well. Observing that the stress-rules for English are radically different from
      those for Latin, Stanyhurst concludes that the strictest application of the Latin rules to
      English will be disastrous, so that he is willing to scan sometimes strictly by syllabic
      quantity (as for words of Latin etymology) and sometimes by letting the accent qualify the
      syllable as long. He speaks much of sounds, but it is clearly the orthography that is the
      actual determinant in practice, as can be seen in his selection between variant spellings of a
      word so as to fit the quanti- tative rules for length by position (which were visual rules
      anyway). But since the Preface to his Aeneis is very short and sketchy, and since his verse is
      in- tended to be read as anything but accentual-syllabic English meter, it is very difficult
      to have a clear grasp of his entire position.Attridge is helpful here; he devotes a short
      chapter to Stanyhurst. </note>

      and marked for natural speech-stresses). Conflict between these two systems is called a
      "cross- draw"; the classical longs and shorts are renamed "strokes" and "flicks," and any
      monosyllable which can be either is called a "rover." Arf. The rules for assigning quantity,

      revisions (by Bridges?)) as Classical Metres in English Verse, the second part of Bridges'
      1901 edition of Milton's Prosody (E495). Omond thought that had Stone lived longer (he died at
      26) his judgments, par- ticularly phonetic, would have been sounder. In any event the
      substance of his theory--and it is a significant statement--would not have changed. Part I of
      his treatise give a short history of previous attempts at quantitative verse and theory in the
      Renaissance and Nineteenth Century; Part II presents his argument. Stone believes that
      classical verse was just the reverse of the modern: Greek meter was quantitative but
      "combated" by speech-accents, while English meter is accentual but opposed by quantities.
      Hence a truly quantitative verse must be metered by quantities with combative(counterpoised)
      accents. Such a verse must be written with strict attention to quantity ("any compromise is
      fa- tal");accent and quantity are not to coincide, as in Tennyson, and accentual imitation of
      quantitative structure is deplorable.Accent in English does not lengthen the syllable, Stone
      thinks, nor do double consonants lengthen the vowel--there is no length by position for us.
      Accent in the modern languages is precisely the same as it was in Greek--a rise in pitch.

      verse in English was commensurate with his attitudes toward other technical matters: he chose
      the high and rocky way. He wrote to satisfy both the classical and the modern systems
      simultaneously; accent and quantity are meant to coincide throughout. </note>

     <note>Trevelyan essays to explain why the English meters never could (and never can) equal the
      mellifluousness, grace, and complexity of the Classical meters of Vir- gil, Horace, Pindar,
      Sappho, etc. His view of our prosody is a Temporalist one: English has only "duple time" and
      "triple time" meters of isochronous bars al- ways beginning on a stress. And the fact, in his
      view, is the explanation: In English the bars must always be equal in duration, but the
      constituent syllables may vary greatly in number or length in order that the bar-lengths come
      out equal. In Classical verse, on the other hand, each syllable has a fixed proportion
      relative to the others, and the lengths of the bars do not matter. The result is regularity
      for our verse but variety for ancient verse. He reviews the various English efforts at
      imitation, especially those of Bridges, and offers his own translation, thinking that any
      successful modern imitation of the classical pat- terns "would have to be mainly indicated and
      expressed by accent." </note>

     <note>The student may begin at p. 266 in Smith. The first twenty or so pages (up to p. 247)
      trace the history of poetry from classical times through Middle English (Webbe notices Gower,
      Chaucer, and the author of Pierce Ploghman, who he says was the first to observe quantity
      without rhyme in English) up to his con- temporaries, Webbe dispensing praise for many but
      condemning the "uncount- able rabble of ryming Ballet makers."The next twenty pages discuss
      the genres, subjects, and moral ends of poetry. The common English verse Webbe observes is
      based upon counting of syllables and rhyme and has three requirements: equivalence of
      line-lengths (the lines must be "answerable" to each other in syllables or feet), observance
      of natural stressing (i.e. an ordering of words such that none are "wrested contrary to the
      natural inclination or affection of the same"), and rhymes which do not wrench violently
      syntax or sense. Diversity of line and stanza is illustrated from the Shepheardes Calendar.
      Webbe notes that the "naturall course"of English verse seems to be iambic, and if the "right
      quantitie" of the words be followed the line will turn out properly as an iamb. But the
      scansions show that this "quantitie" means stress and nothing else. Rhymes and various sorts
      of acrostics are noticed; Webbe then turns (p. 278) to classical-imitative verses, arguing (a
      little opaquely but shrewdly) that even if the languages are dissimilar English should be able
      to adjust its rules to Latin even as Latin did to Greek. He admits that length by position
      will have to be abandoned, he cites twelve types of metrical feet, and he complains that
      monosyllables naturally long in English he was forced to treat as short in his own
      quantitative verses so as to supply the serious deficiency of short syllables in English,
      under the Latin rules. His actual statements about quantity in English are confused and his
      practice is inconsis- tent: his scansions ignore accent altogether yet length by position is
      admitted at points. Examples of Hexameters, Sapphics, and other meters conclude the trea-
      tise. In large part derivative and on the whole unexceptional, Webbe's prosodia is something
      of an anomaly: it seems scarcely to have been noticed by his con- temporaries. Its chief
      characteristic is conservatism. </note>

     <note> In contrast to Alden's earlier English Verse (A1), a collection of examples and
      extracts, the Introduction sets forth his theoretical views on the nature of poetry; the
      salient chapters are 4 and 5 (on metrics) and 6 (on rhyme and stanza forms). His central
      position is that "two elements are equally necessary to the forming of rhythm: the equal
      time-intervals and the stresses which mark them." Meter, then, simply fixes the number of
      syllables regularly repeated in the rhythmic frame. Secondary accent on syllables is allowed,
      which may be either a stress or a slack for metrical purposes, and whever metrical ictus
      conflicts with normal word-stress, "hovering accent" will resolve the clash into compromise.
      And "in general, stress is relative rather than positive." (All of Alden's stress-rules (p.
      172) are ahead of his time.) Quantity, though more variable, is relevant too: when the
      quantity of a syllable is too short for its time-interval, either lengthening or a
      compensatory pause will fill the deficiency; "pauses may also fill the place of wholly missing
      syllables, in order to complete the approximate equality of the time-intervals between
      stresses." The function of meter and the apparent interconvertibility of iambic and trochaic
      meters are explored in detail. Alden reviews several scansion systems, evasively, finally
      settling on the old macron-and breve. Four meters are considered basic, and metrical variation
      is discussed at length, one such device being infrequent substitution of pyrrhics and
      spondees. Far from being a mere student's manual, Alden's treatise tackles nearly every major
      issue in versification head-on, in a sensible yet astute approach, with frequent long
      digressions to review the scholarship on a subject, as well as summaries of his own developing
      arguments. </note>

     <note> "To pronounce in one way and scan in another" is not at all unreasonable, because meter
      is a pure abstraction, assumed by the knowledgeable reader, even though it may be "wholly

      "metrical rests" and explain how stresses outside of ictus are demoted in utterance while
      slacks under ictus may be promoted. Isochronism is only a subjective reality, even though the
      metrical foot has both a temporal and syllabic character, Alden admits. He agrees with Omond
      that "rising and falling rhythms" are essentially the same meter, and he deplores the whole
      conception of acoustics research as a legitimate method in metrics. </note>

      Criticizes J. M. Robertson (E320). Though Alden would "certainly not try to name feet or
      describe lines on any basis other than that of accent," he takes up here the matter of time in
      verse-- that is, rhythm--and examines specifically the Musical Analogy and Quantity. He argues
      that Lanier carried the analogy too far and gives a detailed account of the contrasts between
      verse and music. Variable quantities in English syllables are granted, even though they are
      not metrically ordered, yet Alden argues (this is the crux) that just as speech-accents are
      adjusted in the reading of verse under the pressure of the meter, so too the natural, various
      syllabic quantities may often be adjusted (we know that stressed syllables are commonly
      prolonged, for example), in order that the time-periods between accents will be held equal.
      Even if it were not so cogently prepared for, that conclusion seems reasonable beyond much
      cavil. </note>

     <note> In the exceedingly complex (and convoluted) metrical system presented here, Anderson
      identifies and elaborates on nineteen different types of "stress units" (the term chosen to
      supplant the traditional "foot"), the prototypical unit being a fixed period of time demarked
      by stresses and containing from one to four syllables. The very term itself entails a broader
      premise, which Anderson argues directly: English verse is metered with a basic unit of
      quadruple members. Such a premise naturally forces some unusual scansions, as for example when
      feminine endings are considered the first half of a stress-unit completed at the beginning of
      the following line. Very much attention is given to metrical pauses, and the nineteen types of
      units are eventually reduced to only seven for practical purposes. Section 1 of the treatise
      argues that no real distinction can be drawn between "iambic" and "trochaic," and after the
      subsequent section essays the same for anapest, dactyl, and amphibrach, Anderson concludes in
      the third that "absolutely no line of demarcation can be made between duple and triple"
      meters. No other metrists has ever been willing to go that far. </note>

     <note> Anderson, a New Zealander, was a correspondent with T. S. Omond both in letters and in
      metrical theory. That theory distinguishes poetry from prose by a "temporal metre"--"a rhythm
      of time underlies the words, and once this rhythm has been perceived, syllables can be omitted
      or inserted, accents suppressed . . . without the perception of that rhythm being lost. It is
      this rhythm of time that is metrical. . . . the words and accents float upon the metre."
      Critical of the methods of Guest (E543), Bridges (E491), and Saintsbury (E636), Anderson
      identifies the eight-crested "Romance verse" [i.e., Long Meter] as the stable lyric measure in
      English. The foot is here termed a "stress-unit," and though it seems to him irrelevant
      whether a stress begins or ends the unit, Anderson takes it to end, for the sake of
      convenience. His scansions place a grave accent above the line for "syntactical accents" and a
      short vertical mark below the line for "metrical wavecrests," the coincidence of two marks
      above and below a syllable denoting, then, the "metrical stress." Three basic rhythms of verse
      are identified--those consisting of disyllabic, trisyllabic, and quantrisyllabic units--yet
      strangely enough, Andersen argues that the effects of the disyllabic [duple time] and
      trisyllabic [triple time] rhythms are the same; indeed, he thinks that iambic rhythms can
      become trochaic almost insensibly, based on "a variable sonant hover" on every stressed vowel
      not ending a word: the accented syllable is shorted, he thinks, while the following syllable
      is lengthened (or another syllable inserted in the same duration). The four-syllable rhythm is
      also discussed at length, it being a compound form of the disyllabic rhythm. Line and stanza
      forms occupy the remainder of the book. </note>

     <note> Defining rhythm as "an uninterrupted succession of equal divisions of time, each more or
      less filled with sound," Anderson devotes considerable attention to ballad meter, which he
      persists in (mistakenly) analyzing by the apparatus for foot-verse (rather than stress-verse),
      the foot. To analyze stress-verse in feet is a category mistake, of course, but what is more
      surprising here is that Anderson makes very little of his Temporalist assumptions, instead
      emphasizing that "all blank verse, all ballad verse . . . is essentially iambic" and arguing
      that all the other meters are secondarily derived from the iambic, which itself is modelled on
      our internal cardiac rhythms. </note>

      units," is the "verse unit," consisting (in the full form) of eight stresses and often printed
      in two halves, each half more commonly known as a "line." The native British meter was of
      course the Ballad verse (seven stresses), but it was joined after the Conquest by the Romance
      verse (eight stresses), which had two offspring, the Nibelungen verse and the Alexandrine
      (each of six stresses). Anderson works out all the rhythmical and typographic (i.e. stanzaic)
      variations of these verses, but really, unless one wants examples, the whole genealogy is
      summarized (rather technically) in the dense concluding section (pp. 642-55). </note>

      due observation of time in the recitation of metre" as Rhythm [this indeed is very exact], he
      admits metrical rests, he recognizes isochrony, and he thinks scansion by dipodies simpler.
      Yet the treatment of ancient meter in the last half of the essay surely colors heavily that of
      modern in the first, and we can hear not far behind all this the schoolboy doctrines of a
      classical prosody applied to English verse. Here is the best instance of the conflation and
      confusion of Temporalist and quantitative theories. </note>

     <note> Opposed to all objective theories or measurements of verse, the authors hold that
      metrical pattern inheres "in the perception not in the signal," wherein the mind engages in an
      active perceptual patterning, a pattern of expectation (of stressing recurring at equal
      intervals) projected. As support for this temporal theory of meter the authors record
      schematically some "unled choral reading" of verse by a group [consider the socio-dynamics and
      assumptions behind this method]. The verse is "Pease Porridge Hot," Dickenson, Tennyson, all
      of it close to if not actually stress-verse, so we are not surprised when they "discover" the

     <note> An attempt to answer three of Housman's provocative questions (E297), and with due
      notice of Prall (E318) and Schramm (E428), Bracher argues that every pentameter line is
      followed by a test of one foot (he will not allow metrical rests shorter than a full foot);
      indeed, all lines having an odd number of feet are followed by such a rest, though even-footed
      ones are not, on the grounds that humans naturally tend to compound simple rhythmic impulses,
      but odd-numbered rhythms cannot be resolved into simple groups. Thus blank verse is six-footed
      in actuality. As for the paradox of line-combinations: lines having the same number of feet
      should combine easily whether entirely filled with sound or ending in a rest; verses of
      different feet will combine well if both end in rests but not otherwise. Thus tetrameters and
      trimeters, and pentameters and trimeters, but not tetrameters and pentameters. Finally,
      tetramemeter verse, being entirely filled with sound, requires a rhyme to mark the line-end
      for the ear. Beguiling sense or nonsense? </note>

     <note> Saintsbury (History of English Criticism, p. 512) approved of Gurney's work because it
      recognized that the "music" of poetry is quite different from music itself, that metrical
      rhythm is imposed upon, not latent in, speech," and that the sound-stratum of a poem can
      augment its meaning--"the setting includes a new substance." His book is a study of musical
      form and the psychology of acoustical perception, and in chapter 19 he sets forth a theory of
      meter based on his studies in music. Stresses occur at equal intervals of time, feet may
      contain from one to five syllables, and rests may fill up deficient measures. But the
      distinction (which Saintsbury noted) that Gurney draws between verse- music and tonal-music
      proper is sharply made: the ictus in music normally falls first in the bar, whereas in verse
      it often falls last; "there is no significance in this difference, which in no way affects the
      common feature of regular accents." If iambic verse were set to music, the accented syllables
      would fall first in the musical bars but still last in the meter. "The difference. . .is a

      their energy or inward working, and the harmonous dance into which they are attracted round
      the orb of the beautiful." Its virtues are "strength, sweetness, straightforwardness,
      unsuperfluousness, variety, and oneness." "Strength is the muscle of verse, and shows itself
      in the number and force of the marked syllables. . . . Unexpected locations of the accent
      double this force, and render it characteristic of passion and abruptness. . . . Weakness of
      versification is want of accent and emphasis." Hunt detests inverted syntax but praises

      we are offered new and far more complex rules which, notwithstanding their great laxity, are

      himself is a Timer, though he speaks most often of stress, yet he also wishes to preserve the
      old terms of long and short [it is not clear if he means these as simply ictic and non-ictic],
      allowing "a pause followed by a weak syllable" to count as a long. But he will allow spondees
      and pyrrhics to be stronger and weaker varieties of the iamb, and he shows an astute
      recognition that two systems operate simultaneously in the metrical line- -"grouping by
      section" (syntactic-semantic units) and "grouping by feet" (meter). Within his catch-all
      theory that recognition (see pp. 159-60) is an island of surprising clarity and cogency.

      comprised of accent and quantity, in isochronous periods, but in speech-verse the units are

     <note> In his first monograph Omond posits his axiom that the "period" not the "foot" is the
      unit of English meter. Our verse exhibits quantity (metrical quantity is not to be confused
      with natural linguistic quantity), accent (too fickle to serve as a basis for meter), and
      pause [here Omond fails to distinguish stress-verse from syllable-counting verse], but its
      crucial feature is time not accent. There is no real distinction between iambic and trochaic,
      or anapestic and dactylic, meters; the only true meters in English are "common time" and
      "triple time." But in any event all that the prosodist can hope to elucidate are the
      Principles of verse, not any fixed Rules. Omond surveys briefly the theories of Symonds,
      Bridges, Guest, Poe, Jenkin, Sylvester, Steele, and Ellis. Note his rather over-emphatic
      denial (on p. 54) of any character that he is confusing meter with rhythm; that tone of

      by Verrier and Omond on "Metre," pp. 517-18, 542). The Temporalist theory of verse-structure,
      deriving from Sir Joshua Steele in 1775 (E393), has been most forcefully promoted in our own
      century by Omond, who is very likely also the most articulate spokesman in the entire
      tradition, This monograph is the formal statement of his theory, as opposed to his other works
      of a historical/bibliographical nature. "All meter is essentially rhythmical. That is to say,
      it consists of equal units ["periods"], uniform as regards duration. . . . If periods
      constitute rhythm, they must do so by uniform succession. Syllables do not supply this
      absolute recurrence; their order of succession is changeful, capricious. They need to be
      contrasted with underlying uniformity. That substratum seems afforded by time. Isochronous
      periods form the units of metre" (italics original). The axiom of the theory, then, is that
      the verse-line is a temporal phenomenon constituted of equidurational segments. Accents are
      mainly "signaling elements" used simply to mark or signal periodicities. Accent cannot be the
      constituent or base of meter, Omond argues, because stress rules in English are too fickle to
      regulate verse: word-accent is too easily disfigured by sentence-accent (but see p. 24). Omond
      cautiously accepts Blake's theory of monopressures (E484) to explain the physiology of accent.
      Quantity is acknowledged a fact of our language and our verse, though ornamental rather than
      constitutive; poets who write verse "based solely on quantity may be said to sin against the
      genius of their language." Metrical pause is a crucial component of meter as well, this to be
      distinguished from the various pauses for effect in performance. Of metrical types Omond
      allows four: two measures, duple and triple, in two modes, rising and falling. (Blake's theory

      syllable being either followed or preceded by as many as two unaccented ones. Meter then
      becomes merely the building-up of lines from such "rhythmic" "feet." He allows nine such
      "feet," finding the pyrrhic "very frequent." Worse still, it seems to matter little whether
      the accent is marked at the end of the foor or at the beginning. Parsons reinterates his

     <note> This is unquestionably the best available discussion of the general nature of
      temporality in the form of the poem, with its implications for our understanding of the
      ontological status of "the poem," and hence the modes of respose which are available for
      criticism. Critics as a rule have been more than reluctant to even admit that a poem might
      have a temporal dimension, formally (some metrists have argued quite the reverse, of course),
      even though they recognize obvious temporal structuring in narration or plotting. But such a
      reluctance constitutes a confession of ignorance, and the perpetuation of it an appeal to
      ignorance. Some recent codifications in metrical theory offer hope of a solution, and the key
      to the whole problem might well be "abstract metre apprehended as a temporal construct." But
      in fact there are a number of "clocks" simultaneously regulating the timing of poetry (though
      note: the notion of isochonous lines in verse is false). Too, timing effects may arise from
      lexical and semantic levels as well as formal, if not all of these together. A proper temporal
      analytic should be operable at both the macro- and the micro-levels of the art-work. An

     <bibl>"Poet's Prosody in Perspective." Poe Studies 5 (1972): 61-62. </bibl>
     <note> Eaton takes issue with Greenwood's opinion of Poe's prosody by showing in detail the
      difficulty--and necessity--of an accurate historical understanding of prosodic thought in
      Poe's time, or any time. Poe "marked stresses, he confused them with quantities, and he
      counted syllables." Thus the temporalist theory of one age overlaps the stress theory of
      another age, and both are only partly or vaguely understood by poets as well as grammarians of
      the time. Is it any wonder prosody is so hard to read aright? The "Rationale" essay is an
      amplification of an earlier study, "Notes on English Verse," published in The Pioneer for
      March 1843. With his accustomed vigor of tendentious rhetorical argumentation, Poe takes up
      the standard of the old longs and shorts, insisting on the quantitative terminology for
      English as well as Latin. Accent determines length, but Poe's system of prosody really rests
      on time. Admitting that quantity is infinite in gradation yet clutching the dogma of
      one-long-equals-two-shorts, Poe is driven, by the fact of extrametrical syllables in lines, to
      devise a cumbersome--nearly ludicrous-- system of halves, thirds, and sixths, indicating
      syllabic duration in scansion with numbers and fractions, and allowing, besides the only feet
      he recognizes-- iamb, trochee, anapest, dactyl, spondee, and "caesura" (a single long
      syllable)-- a host of other misbegotten siblings: "bastard iamb," bastard dactyl," etc., and
      the "quick trochee." His refusal to admit pyrrhics into the system is transparently
      casuistical. And Poe differentiates rhythm from meter only in that the former identifies the
      feet while the latter denotes the number of feet per line, which is scarcely any cutting
      distinction. Altogether, the conservatism and the confusion in Poe's thinking produce an
      extravagently indefensible system. Yet against this one must say that the "Rationale" essay
      has been fertile ground for subsequent work: we find here the notion that a poetic line must
      "read itself" (be incapable of misarticulation), and concept of the "variable foot," and the
      abstract principle of "equality" (also termed "proportionality" and "equivalence" developed so
      importantly a century later by a distinguished Slavist and linguist. The "Philosophy of
      Composition" and "Poetic Principle" essays contain some remarks on versification that are too
      familiar to require notice. The "Marginalia" (vol. 16, pp. 111-12 in the Complete Works)
      reiterate Poe's fascination with strict laws of mathematics, and he reminds us that laws
      deduced from observable effects are by no means identical to those controlling composition.
      The salutary effect of rhyme is said to depend on recurrence at "unanticipated intervals."
      Finally, Poe's 1843 review of The Poets and Poetry of America contains a short synopsis of his
      views of versification (vol. 11 of the Works, pp. 225-36). </note>

      others, rhythm "corresponds in its movement with the movement of the soul" directly. For
      Schwartz, whatever is abstracted is meter; the rhythm is inseparable from performance. Meters
      he thinks may correspond to "general classes of feelings." All this is wooly, which Perry has
      little trouble showing in his reply. Imitative and expressive metrical effects are not to be

      43-58. Schwartz's reply to Wimsatt and Beardsley (E700) perceives clearly that unless they
      "recognize the psychological status of rhythm, they cannot be made to see its temporal basis."
      W &amp; B amplify Leonard Meyer's distinction between pulse, rhythm, and meter, then clarify
      their own position: "meter. . . is what we actually hear in the poem when it is read aloud;
      rhythm is something which is aroused in the mind by means of the poem's meter, something which
      is felt by the listener and which in turn stirs his further feelings." (Thus, for them meter
      is objective, rhythm subjective, while for Schwartz meter is subjective and rhythm objective.)
      S. responds with his counterassertion "that meter is real, that it is distinct from rhythm,
      and that both meter and rhythm are temporally measured." Being perfectly abstract, meter is
      never actually heard, but rather is inferred: It "exists in the mind of the reader" as a
      "normative pattern" of expectation. What we actually perceive are the strong stresses and the
      temporal intervals between them, intervals roughly but not precisely equivalent. It is neither
      necessary nor possible to show that syllabic durations are physically equal. "Meter is an
      ideal temporal norm." The meter and rhythm are correlated by the reader simultanously, via
      "double audition." Schwartz argues that inverted feet are preceded by pauses, so that
      "trochaic substitutions" are actually a pause + a monosyllable + an anapest. W &amp; B's final
      response expresses skepticism as to this last and reasserts their belief that Schwartz
      actually proves their own case. </note>

     <note> Musical metrists have a problem with the metrical terms "iambic/trochaic" and
      "rising/falling," since these distinctions do not exist in music. One or the other--analogy or
      terminology--must go. Stewart, assuming that trochaic meter equals falling rhythm, counts the
      number of falling, rising, and neutral stress-patterns in the phrases of several "trochaic"
      and "iambic" poems, discovering thereby that the proportions of all three are in each case
      quite mixed, with many neutrals, and that the falling phrases are only slightly more frequent
      in "trochaic" verse than in "iambic," and not at all predominant even within the "trochaic."
      All that one can say is that the mixes are pretty thorough and that we discriminate some
      extremely subtle shifts quite markedly. But the distinctions "iambic/trochaic" and
      "rising/falling" Stewart finds unwarranted. Cf. Newton (E799), Hascall (E783), Creek (E18),

      a more simplified analysis a Dipodic Index can be derived for a given poem, and Stewart finds
      that dipodism begins to be clearly perceived at about index 35. But the most intriguing

     <note> One of the most substantial studies published in the first half of this century; Stewart
      is perhaps the least temporal (certainly the least dognatically so) of Timers, and his book
      can make that theory more attractive to confirmed Stressers than any of the rest. His approach
      offers two distinctive and significant features: Phrasing, and Dipodism. For scansion the
      following siglia are employed: S O o p l P = = = = = = stressed syllable heavy unstress
      unstressed syllable pause for an unstress light stress pause for a stress; these Stewart
      deploys in groups in scansions so as to indicate not only the stress- pattern of the line
      (note he has four levels available rather than two) but also the syntactic structure, the
      phrasal boundaries. The system is simple, efficient, and doubly informative. Notice that
      Stewart's simple and compound phrasing corresponds precisely to constituent analysis in
      structural linguistics, and that by including phrase-structure he is able to account for
      "rising" and "falling" rhythms more adequately than anyone else. On the temporal aspect he is
      modest but firm: the "time-structures" of verse are "practically identical," and so Stewart
      begins the first foot of the line with the first stress. Unfortunately this forces him to call
      a 5-foot line a 4-foot line with "a little left over at beginning and end" which is neither
      elegant nor efficient, and Stewart wisely chooses not to pursue this course. He allows four
      feet--the monosyllabic, iambic, trochaic, and amphibrachic--and of course he makes much of the
      metrical pause. When he comes to quadruple meters, i.e. Dipodic verse, his analysis again
      merits praise for charting new terrain. His scansion notation allows much further progress
      than Patmore (E384) was able to make. But notice: nearly all his examples are ballads, and the
      import of his analysis is to rewrite stress-verse as a highly regular meter bordering on
      foot-verse by the liberal insertion of metrical pauses; the ultimate result of this tack will
      be to eliminate entirely the concept of stress-verse, where the slack syllables are
      unconstrained. Much food for thought here. See Stewart's article at K379 and his earlier

      basic metrical patterns or systems are identified: Variable, Doubtful, and Fixed. In the
      Variable pattern (example: Old English alliterative), the constraints are relatively weak. In
      the Doubtful pattern, the numbering of syllables is rigidly controlled but their timing is
      generally uncontrolled, causing metrists to be "doubtful" of the nature of the prosodic base.
      But as the constraints increase, the timing too is Fixed, creating that sort of stress-verse
      where the reader can scarcely miss the intended timing of the line. A long fifth chapter takes
      up the "Spoken Line," a subject, current opinion notwithstanding, which is indispensable to
      metrics. Taig's analysis of the double-stranded rope of performance--the metrical expectation
      perceived simultaneously with the rhythmic/syntactic ordering--raises the tantalizing prospect
      that "the forms employed in the utterance can be reduced to a few well-defined types, that the
      speech-variations of blank verse can be classified at least as easily as those of the
      alliterative line in Old English." This analogy is pursued through a short analysis, and three
      Groups of line-patterns are also identified which seem to operate in the metrical
      orchestration of long passages of verse (5 waves, 4, and 3). A short final chapter traces the
      parallel historical development of rhythmical counterpoint in music and in verse. Replacing
      Taig's term "wave" by the more familiar "bar" or "foot," one might claim that this book is
      merely old familiar tea in an unfamiliar package, yet the seeming glibness of the term belies
      the broad learning and deep thinking consistently evidenced here. Any reader who believes that
      deep thinking can come to a trivial and conventional conclusion does not understand deep
      thinking. This is a difficult book, in both the negative and positive sense of the word. See

      (E88). Bayfield pushes the musical analogy to verse to its ultimate logical end, that is, into
      absurdity: since the stress begins the bar in music, therefore all English verse has always
      been written in a trochaic meter; indeed, by definition, the iambic foot cannot exist. Stress
      is acknowledged central to English verse, but stressed syllables are said to last twice as
      long as unstressed in utterance, and recur at equal intervals, i.e. in "triple-time." Bayfield
      seems to have read none of his contemporaries. Now, Omond's view of this whole business was
      that the whole uproar raised by the appearance of Bayfield's books was pointless and
      unnecessary, the argument itself being tautology and calling for no response. In other words,
      if everyone is agreed on the stressing of a line, it makes no difference where the bar-marks
      for foot-division are drawn: it makes no difference whether we call the line iambic or
      trochaic. Possibly this logic is too radically simple to strike me as correct, but I cannot
      believe that (1) there is no syntactic or metrical difference between what are commonly called
      "rising rhythms" and "falling rhythms," or that (2) the long history of what poets thought
      they were doing, in writing in the iambic pentameter tradition, counts for nothing at all. Cf.

      the most important available (and widely ignored) source currently on rhythm in music, Cooper
      and Meyer (N30), summarizing its premises: "in music, meter is pulse plus accent, rhythm is
      accent plus grouping," and "a 'rhythmic pattern' in music is what prosodists are wont to call
      a 'metrical pattern' in verse." (Note the implication that rhythm is a higher-order concept
      than meter.) He does not, however, adequately explain their hierarchical scansions, as he does
      not adequately explain his own--his second subject. Proposed is a scansion-system I have not
      seen elsewhere, which appears to account for both metrical pattern and syntactic (i.e.
      rhythmical) grouping, and can explain the complex, unified, double sense of movement in lines
      of verse that we are commonly aware of. Beardsley then reviews, disinterestedly, the arguments

     <note> Introduction to the essay and its historical context by Evans, pp. 361-64. The essay was
      first printed in mimeograph by the English Dept. of Princeton in 1929, though it may have
      existed as early as 1923-24. See s.v. Croll in NUC. Rev: in Anglia 85 (1967): 184-85; in
      Seventeenth Century News 25 (1967): 45- 46; in Modern Language Journal 51 (1967): 112-13; in
      Thought 42 (1967): 295- 97. This short monograph outlines Croll's system of musical metrics,
      which is derived from Lanier (E364) and closely parallel to Thomson (E404), whose work Croll
      apparently did not see until its publication in 1923, the date of the first version of his own
      essay. For scansion notation Croll employs a system of superlinear horizontal bar-lines with
      flags to denote time-values. He considers iambic/trochaic verse to be in triple time,
      anapestic/dactylic in duple, so stressed syllables are tacitly granted double the duration of
      unstressed. Following illustration of these two, a long section treats the "double or compound
      measure," i.e. dipodic meter. Here Croll treats the ballad meters, though his attempt to scan
      every ballad as if it were dipodic is very obviously unreasonable. A final section postulates
      the existence of yet one higher level, the "double-compound" (double-dipodic) measure, in
      effect in double- quadruple time, one measure would therefore contain four degrees of stress,
      i.e. This, too, seems an improbable complication, and examples are scarce. </note>

      one extract: Eliot reminds us that the study of metrics is a useful and necessary occupation
      but only at an early stage, for "a study of anatomy will not teach you how to make a hen lay
      eggs": assimilation and imitation create good poetry, not scansion or analysis. English verse
      has received influence from many foreign verse-forms, and Eliot suggests that there may be two
      systems operant at once in our meter even as accent and quantity both were attended to in late
      Latin verse. But he insists that meter cannot be studied apart from meaning. There is no such
      thing as appreciating the melody of verse without understanding its sense. "Melody" is not
      mere mellifluousness, and the mimetic or semantic range of pure sound is quite limited.
      Altogether, poetry is close kin to conversation, and cannot afford to stray far or long from

     <note> Interested in "what affinities to music may be discerned in the features that poetry
      shares with music--sound and rhythm," Frye elucidates some of the manifold "confusion between
      the musical and the euphonious" in poetry. "Music" of course is not "beauty of sound" but
      "organization of sound." Hence, "when we find a careful balancing of vowels and consonants and
      a dreamy sensuous flow of sound, we are probably dealing with an unmusical poet. Pope, Keats,
      and Tennyson are all unmusical. . . . When we find sharp barking accents, crabbed and obscure
      language, mouthfuls of consonants, and long, lumbering polysyllables, we are probably dealing
      with melos, or poetry which shows an analogy to music, if not an actual influence from it."
      Metrically, "when in poetry we have a predominating stress accent and a variable number of
      syllables between two stresses . . . we have musical poetry, that is, poetry which resembles
      in its structure the music contemporary with it." Frye believes that behind the iambic
      pentameter lies a four-stress line which "seems to be inherent in the structure of the English
      language," adducing as proof some musical scansions of lines from Lydgate and Skelton. (This I
      think is a confusion of meter for rhythm.) Imitative effects are also discussed. In sum, Frye
      posits that the two varieties of poetic melos arise "the one from the external influence of
      music, the other, internal, from the language itself." </note>

     <note> Intended as an apologia for and simplified exposition of Lanier's system of temporal

      music," he considers the binary meters to be in triple rhythm, and he scans alternately with
      musical notation and with numerals indicating syllabic duration (he believes that the auditor
      can discriminate syllable-lengths of 3⁄4, 1, 11⁄2, and 2). And though Hendren recognizes four
      degrees of stress, his scansions strongly suggest a belief that stressed syllables are doubled
      in length--a ghost we had thought long since buried. Hendren has no evidence for that claim
      other than an appeal to authority, and he recognizes rightly that objective studies of rhythm
      are less relevant than subjective (perceptual) ones. But any thorough study of Lanier will
      find some salient observations and sensible adjustments of his theory herein. See Hendren's

     <note> [Hendren has the first six pages, W &amp; B the last three.] Hendren begins his reply to
      Wimsatt and Beardsley by collapsing several crucial distinctions ("to reject measured time as
      an integral character of metrical structure is to deny the existence of verse rhythm"; "we
      cannot. . . separate meter from the performance"; and tapping out the beats of a blank- verse
      line "will show its triple rhythm and its plain arrangement of long and short syllables"),
      then argues that the isochronism which may be demonstrated in tapping out lines is not
      mathematically precise; the durations are but "sensibly equal." He recites the obligatory
      temporalist litany of Poetry-and- Music, approves the work of Snell, Schramm, and Thomson,
      then returns finally to a methodical countering of the points raised by Wimsatt and Beardsley,
      especially the picket-fence analogy. Wimsatt and Beardsley in their reply expand their scope
      to Hendren's monograph (E356), attacking his assumptions ("measures when recited will often
      differ enormously") as well as the experimental evidence for isochrony. They respond to
      Hendren's crucial query "If the stresses are not measuring time in the recitation of the
      verse, what are we to suppose they are measuring instead?" with a trenchant answer,
      "Syllables, number of syllables, are measured--syllables grouped according to stress and
      slack, so many slacks between each stress." And they summarize their traditional position
      concisely: "Syllabic quantitative meters are not possible in English because syllabic quantity
      is not an objective feature of English. Isochronism (of intervals between primary stresses, as
      urged by the linguists) is not a principle of English meter, because if it is an actual
      feature of the language, it is a constant feature and is hence not susceptible of the
      manipulation by which the poet distinguishes metrical from non-metrical." They even go so far
      as to disparage Hendren for "the irrelevance of his theory to actual problems of English
      meter." </note>

      verse meter from its origin in music, the later forced conflations of dissimilar metrical
      systems in verse (Latin with Greek, Romance with Old English), and the resultant confounding
      of prosodic terminology. Finally, his remarks on the convenient imprecisions and the category
      mistakes of musical theories of meter are trenchant, and his insistence on a recognition of
      the distinction between performative and descriptive systems of scansion amounts to something
      like a sine qua non for all future theories of English meter. </note>

     <note> We are told that "reasoning has nothing whatever to do with the matter of rhythm," a
      statement this article indeed bears out. Kroeger scans by length, one long equalling two
      shorts, but marks meter (calling it rhythm) with musical notation, a procedure which results
      in the incredible blunder of calling iambic-trochaic patterns triple time and
      dactylic-anapestic patterns duple (common) time. Even so, he complains that the macron-breve
      notation of poetry cannot indicate more subtle variations of tempo, and he admits that
      quantities in speech vary enormously. </note>

      Lanier. Vol. II. The Science of English Verse and Essays on Music. Ed. P. F. Baum. Baltimore:
      Johns Hopkins University Press, 1945. (Baum's Introduction should not be overlooked). A
      seminal text in metrical theory, less interesting in itself perhaps than for the sake of the
      enormous influence it exerted on critical conceptions of poetic form for more than forty years
      after its publication. The axiom of all of Lanier's thought is that human speech (and, by
      extension, spoken verse-- poetry) is a sound-phenomenon, produced by a reed instrument (the
      vocal apparatus), and organized in duration , pitch, and intensity (principally the first),
      making it theoretically indistinguishable from music. That is, he conceives of verse and music
      not merely as analogous phenomena but as coincident in origin and correpondent in
      ordering-principles--"the two species of the genus art of sound." From this one axiom of the
      identity of all patterning of Sound, three propositions may be derived which apply equally to
      music and verse and produce differing effects merely due to the qualitative differences in
      "musical sounds" and "spoken words": these propositions express the co-ordinations of the ear
      in terms of duration, pitch, and quality as (respectively) Rhythm, Tune, and Tone-Color.
      Rhythm, the subject which occupies Part I of the treatise, may be classed as primary or
      secondary and occurs in 3-rhythm and 4-rhythm modes, as we learn in music. Lanier thinks "no
      circumstance in the history of aesthetics so curious as the overpowering passion of the
      English [poetic] ear for 3-rhythm as opposed to 4-rhythm." For scansion, of course, the line
      of verse is denoted by a time-signature and musical notes expressing the durations of the
      syllables. Metrical (musical) rests are therefore permissible and valuable features of
      verse-structure. Part II, entirely ignored by subsequent scholars, treats Tune; Part III,
      rhyme (at length), alliteration (short notes), and Sylvester's "phonetic syzygy" (E402).
      Metrical analysis of Shakespeare's verse receives considerable attention; see pp. 185-224.
      Lanier's achievement in the history of metrical theory was to systematize the verse-music
      analogy and to popularize the musical scansion-sigla suggested by Sir Joshua Steele (E394) a
      century earlier. A century later he is not followed at all, his musical scansions actually
      being thought unduly precise and therefore denoting features of performance rather than
      paradigms. And there is the added twist that Lanier's scansions depart from all established
      musical convention in not placing the accented note first in the bar--this seems a flagrant
      inconsistency in the sort of theory where consistency is only less crucial a criterion than
      clarity. Omond (A5) appreciated the book (see pp. 195-202) but Saintsbury rattled his armor
      (A8, vol. 3, pp. 493-97). See also J214. For two modern applications of Lanier's theory to Old
      and Middle English verse, see Pope (J241, J242) and Schiller (K329). See also Hendren (E356)

      in musical notation, and iambic verse is said to be in Triple time based on Snell's conclusion
      (E452) that stressed syllables are twice as long as unstressed. Meter we can only identify

      from rhythm, though she does hold that "verse feet and measures identify different phenomena,

      time-signatures (though iambic verse is usually in triple time, stressed syllables being
      double the length of unstressed), though transpositions occur in performance. "Rhetorical
      accents" are preserved as "isochronous accents" in the line even when they do not match the
      ideal pattern of "metrical stresses." The formulations here are new, but the concepts

      it is saturated with classical prosodic and musical terminology and is therefore quite
      convoluted. "Numbers" seems to mean "feet" (pp. 10-11), these being the aggregates of
      "Rhythms" (12-14), both irregular and regular. Of verse (Chapter 4), Manwaring holds that
      English Versification is "made according to the diatonic scale," i.e., the "half and whole
      Times" of the iambic or trochaic feet are analogous to the half and whole steps or Tones in
      music. Iambic verse on this account would be in triple time, and in fact it is barred so that
      the "first syllable in every full foot" is "acuted" (accent is based on pitch here). English
      verse, we are told near the end, must attend to accent, quantity, and "Concord"
      (caesure-placement); the pentameter "is a seventh in music." Fussell's remarks on this work

      in both the Classical languages and Modern English, but that the laws of quantity in Modern
      English are not the same as those for the classical languages; he notes a "rhythmizing
      instinct" in our reading aloud of nursery rhymes, as opposed to our "normal unrhythmical

     <note> Quantity is as distinct from accent in classical Greek as it is in modern English; our
      verse is based on "emphasis," the term "accent" being used for pitch or musical tone, as in
      classical speech. Thereafter, Odell follows Steele (E394) on "cadence": "Rhythmus is a general
      term, comprising two distinct modes, which are called common time and triple time, or common
      and triple metre. . . . rhythmus has its essence in arsis and thesis, but metre in syllables
      and in their difference." Syllable length by position is rejected, and since emphasis is said
      to have controlled quantity even in Greek, "metre is always subordinate to rhythmus." The
      metrical cadence is "equivalent to a musical bar," and so begins an emphatic syllable; it may
      contain a metrical rest, so that all the cadences will have equal duration. </note>

      Patmore's Poems, 1894. Her bibliography contains 281 entries. The "critics" Patmore has in
      mind are mainly Guest (E543) and O'Brian (M151). Though most of Patmore's ideas were not new
      at the time, still his essay has been very influential, and it stands as one of the three or
      four major documents in the evolution of the Temporal theory of verse. In the essay he pursues
      vigorously the case for verse being divided into "isochronous intervals," though he holds
      these to be perceptually (mentally) equal rather than physically. These intervals are to be
      demarcated by "an 'ictus' or 'beat,' actual or mental. . . . it has no material and external
      existence at all." (One notes the conflation or confusion of metrical ictus and speech stress
      here.) Mitford (E600) and Steele (E394) are praised, and Hegel's Aesthetics provides some
      further foundation. But Patmore's most important and original contribution is his argument
      that English verse is all dipodic: "the elementary measure, or integer, of English verse is
      double the measure of ordinary prose,--that is to say, it is the space which is bounded by
      alternate accents; that every verse proper contains two, three, or four of these 'metres,' or
      as with a little allowance they may be called, 'dipodes.'" He also argues the importance of
      medial and final metrical pauses. O'Brian's work prompts an argument that alliteration in
      Anglo-Saxon was no mere ornament but a metrical device needed to mark the accents; by
      extension, the, rhyme in modern verse serves a metrical function also. See also Stobie (E944)

      that, at all events in verse, it may be considered as identical with quantity"; if the

     <bibl>Prosodia Rationalis: or an Essay Towards Establishing [etc.]. London: T. Payne &amp; Son,
      1779. </bibl>
     <note> Bysshe's influence on the eighteenth century is greater (simply by precedence), but
      Steele is among the two or three most influential figures in the entire history of English
      versification, as well as a major figure in the history of phonetics. He is responsible for
      charting an entirely new course in verse- theory, despite the fact that his magnum opus,
      Prosodia Rationalis, is a treatise on suprasegmental phonology, not metrics. Steele's theory
      of verse influenced Thelwall, Odell, Chapman, and Roe, and after them Coventry Patmore, A. J.
      Ellis, Sidney Lanier, T. S. Omond, and John C. Pope. He devoted his career to devising a set
      of orthographic symbols to transcribe the inflectional features of English speech (stress,
      pitch, and duration) and, by extension, the structure of English verse; these were
      quasi-musical. Hence Steele transfers the structure of music, vis |`a vis verse, from the
      level of analogy to the level of identity. In adapting music to describe verse he was preceded
      by Gildon (E164), but Gildon never applied the idea beyond a mere example. Steele deserves the
      credit for elaborating the system formally; he shrugs off the half-hearted efforts of the
      earlier prosodists and reaches out to grasp the wider theoretical implications of the ideas he
      is pursuing. Prosodia Rationalis, however, is more a book to be read about than read. It began
      as a reply to Lord Monboddo and his doctrine that "the music of our language. . . [is] nothing
      better than the music of a drum, in which we perceive no difference except that of louder or
      softer." But as each section of Steele's argument was completed, he sent it off for Lord
      Monboddo's comments, which were then incorporated along with Steele's replies in subsequent
      sections of the book: "consequently, Prosodia Rationalis is, in effect, an extended dialogue
      between the two men, to which is appended, in the second edition, an additional series of
      questions from other hands, together with the author's replies." (Omond). Steele obviously
      went far out of his way to present his system as even-handedly as possible. His system
      distinguishes five features: • accent: by which Steele means pitch, or tone, and which he is
      perceptive enough to recognize changes in even slides, not in discrete or abrupt shifts; •
      quantity: meaning relative duration of syllables or pauses. Steele uses quasi- musical symbols
      to denote "accent" and quantity simultaneously, the heads denoting the direction of
      pitch-change, the tails (tails above heads in his system), duration: • emphasis: a term Steele
      uses ambivalently and confusedly to denote both the absolute duration between stresses
      (cadence, bar), and also the stresses themselves, based on the analogy of the systolic
      circulatory system of the human body, the heartbeat of which is both regular and intensified.
      Hence Steele considers syllables either "heavy" or "light" (poise is the general term for this
      phenomenon), and he distinguishes three degrees, heavy, light, and lightest; "the rhythmus or
      measure of speech is the number of cadences in a line or stanza"; • pause: in four durations:
      semibreve, minim, crotchet, and quaver; and • force: or loudness, also in four gradations:
      louder, loud, soft, softer. In versification, time not syllables is to be the basis of meter;
      the concept of the metrical pause originates with Steele. But he recognizes also that even if
      the structure of verse is actually that of music the pentameter line cannot be scanned with
      bar-lines before the stresses, i.e. with a final monosyllabic foot and an initial anacrusis;
      instead, Steele scans it with a stressed rest beginning the line and an unstressed rest at the
      end: (/p) I do not think that you will ever know (p). The five-foot line thus becomes a six-
      or even as much as an eight- in some cases; Steele does not seem to mind the extremities of
      this position. Mixing of common and triple time is therefore no problem at all, nor is
      trisyllabic substitution, since everything depends soley on time. Altogether, one may say that
      Steele's ideas were, with some slight qualifications, essentially sound. The notion of
      emphasis is the chief weakness of his analysis. Some of his transcriptions are unreliable, but
      since he had no technology to support him, no recorders or oscilloscopes for playback, he had
      to rely on his ear alone for the one and only hearing of the line. In the history of phonetics
      he position is very firm. In the history of versification he represents the first, perhaps the
      foremost, proponent of a view that has not been widely accepted as the correct account of
      meter but which has been widely recognized as legitimate, even indispensable, as an account of
      rhythm. After Lanier even several of the prominent Temporal metrists shied away from the
      concept of music as anything more than analogy to verse, yet these judgments could be
      comfortably made from the distance of a century and a half from Steele's pioneering work.

     <author>Stevenson, Charles L.</author>
     <bibl>"The Rhythm of English Verse." JAAC 28 (1970): 327-44. </bibl>
     <note> Drawing upon concepts from the earlier work of Steele (E394), Andrews (E335), and
      Stewart (E333), Stevenson deploys a full-fledged theory of English meter that rests on both
      stressing and timing, distinguishes metrical ictus from speech stress, adopts some of the
      features of the analogy of verse to music while recognizing sensibly and explicitly the
      weaknesses and limitations of that analogy, and derives a "foot-free prosody" based on the
      whole line. With a very striking illustration, Stevenson demonstrates the difference between
      "metrical stress" (ictus) and "accent" (speech stress) and the functions of the former: as
      conspicuously regular markers of the metrical paradigm, metrical stresses "have a partitioning
      effect: they help us to see the pattern as composed of sub-patterns. . . . [they] provide
      consecutive 'frames' that divide the total 'picture' into smaller 'pictures.' The frames,
      moreover, are similar frames. So they invite us to compare the pictures within them, noticing
      when they are alike and when they are different. . . . The frames help us to make the visual
      comparisons on which our sense of organization depends." The two features which establish
      ictus are approximately equal timing and limited variability of syllables (i.e. the number of
      syllables must be relatively small and relatively uniform). Stevenson sees that timing is only
      "a part of the explanation." Alliteration, stanza-pattern, and pitch can also occasionally
      help mark ictus. "Metrical stresses are as if ornamental frames, of aesthetic interest in
      their own right." Music is indeed analogous to verse in that the stresses in verse begin
      "stress-intervals" equivalent to musical bars (Stevenson claims that "to call a
      stress-interval by the name foot" is "entirely misleading," but what's in a name? The concept
      of sub-linear metrical unit is retained.), and metrical pauses are admissible, as is
      syncopation. Yet pauses in verse may be ambivalent, though not so in music, and verse-pauses
      cannot be "held" over several beats as in music, even besides the obviously greater syllabic
      variation possible in music, so the analogy has decided limitations and is "always a little
      misleading" anyway. But syllabic length and syntactic phrase-structure, though both quite
      variable in English verse, are susceptible to marking in scansion and should be noticed.
      Finally, in a long and important penultimate section, Stevenson argues that the stubborn
      retention of the "foot" by prosodists has been a result of a fundamental misconception: they
      have been sidetracked by undue emphasis on the beginning of the line and have believed that
      the metering of the rest of the line must operate on a principle of the "best echo" of the
      onset. But the phrase-structure usually belies any clear echoes, and the "foot" therefore
      appears very artificial. This misconception may have arisen from the general nature of poetic
      composition, which Stevenson hypothosizes operates mainly on the principle of limited syllabic
      variability between ictus, extended also to the line-beginning. Such a general principle
      produces "facts" capable of varying interpretation. Stevenson's interpretation, on the whole,
      is provocative and extensive; his approach is remarkably sensible. </note>

      Quantity, and Suspensions. The Synectic, again, consists of Anastomosis, Symptosis, and

      Following an opening review (and rejection) of the Pychological approach to poetic rhythm
      (Attention Span and Kinesthesis theories), the author comes to her point and method. "We are
      going to collate the prosody of poetry with that of music." This thesis she will pursue even
      beyond the shortcomings of Lanier and others. "We may define [the foot] in accents, in
      quantities, as an isochronous interval, a monopressure, a centroid. . . . We disagree in
      almost every conceivable way about the composition of the foot, delimiting and refining, but
      here let us take our motto--Prosody, beware of exclusion. There is not one thing, metrical
      form." This is fair, but worse follows: "Consequently we shall not narrow the meaning of foot,
      but follow Saintsbury's lead in shirking a farther definition." But her scansions show not
      only notes and bars but also "feet" which seem to be basically syntactic and word boundaries.
      She accepts a system from Prout's Musical Form providing "Fore Phrase" and "After Phrase,"
      each of these having an A and B section, each section having a and b "feet" (exemplified in
      the hemistichic octosyllabic couplet). This system allows her to describe (for fifty pages)
      complex phrasing patterns in verse. See also her essay </note>

     <note> An important study, unjustly neglected, which draws some radical conclusions from
      kymograph recordings of speech (Brown makes some trenchant criticisms of the assumptions
      behind all finger-tapping and motor-response methodologies) and applies them to theories of
      meter and rhythm. "There is nothing in the temporal regularity of simpler rhythmic processes
      which contradicts the assumption of a non-temporal theory of rhythm. And the lack of temporal
      regularity in verse makes such an assumption inoperative." There is no equality of durations
      in verse-rhythm. "Is it not natural, then, to conclude that time equality is an inference
      derived from the apparent equality of two impressions or expressions and confirmed by actual
      equalities in many rhythms, but not really a constitutive factor in the rhythm at all? . . .
      In the end it will be much simpler to talk of a rhythm which is actually present . . . the
      beats of which are not fixed in time, while its effect upon us is that of a series of equal
      time intervals." And none of the six theories of meter hitherto advanced (quantitative,
      accentual, musical, stress-verse, centroid, temporal- syllabic) can account for the facts by
      itself. An adequate theory of meter will have to account for everything--duration, intensity,
      pitch, etc. "The empirical facts leave no room for a theory of verse rhythm based merely on
      time." Cf. Boomsliter, Creel, and Hastings (E282). </note>

      can be found between dactylic and anapestic feet, and to a lesser extent between trochaic and
      iambic, in terms of the temporal durations of the constituents of the foot: where a is the
      shortest syllable and c the longest, the dactylic pattern in bac, the anapestic abc. </note>

      significant errors in method: (1) he believed all English verse to be in triple time (much of
      it is commonly double); (2) he believed the meters (e.g. iambic and trochaic) to be
      rhythmically distinct from each other (Jacob denies it); (3) he believed meter a crucial
      element of verse ("the one essential of verse is rhythm. . . . the phrase and not the line is
      the thing to be considered"). </note>

     <note> Calling for a review of the methodological utility and perceptual validity of Liddell's
      six-level stress system and his 86 laws of speech rhythm, Morris formulates three questions as
      criteria for evaluation: "the question of how accurate is his notation of the relative stress.
      . . . the question of the relation of stress to the other four component physical factors,
      pitch, time, tempo, and tone color. . . . and a third question of the relation of normal
      word-stress to sense-stress." Criticizing Liddell's treatment of the third problem and setting
      aside the second, Morris examines the first: four men read then scanned passages of verse;
      phonetic analyses of the readings, along with the scansions, were then compared with Liddell's
      own scansions. All three were very similar, and so the six-level notation is tentatively
      confirmed as perceptually valid. Table of Results. </note>

     <note> In his later years, however, Scripture turned from phonetics to versification, studying
      a variety of verseforms in both English and German and publishing a considerable number of
      articles on meter and "the melody of speech" (pitch) in verse as he codified and applied his
      theory of versification, which is summarized in the last major work of his life, the
      Grundz|"uge. All of the articles on verse that Scripture published both before and after that
      book are based on its theory, so I cite them below with little commentary. The core of that
      theory is the postulate that the poetic line, based on observed recordings of speech, is a
      continuous soundstream, not segmented into any discrete units called "feet," but rather
      organized by major internal peaks of "energy" (convergences of intensity, loudness, pitch,
      articulation) which group their proclitic and enclitic syllables around themselves to form
      wave-like forms in the soundstream. Scripture refused to admit that syllable- boundaries could
      be identified (though inconsistently he admitted the existence of syllabicity), so no
      segmentation was possible. The result was that he was forced to search for line-types, given
      his view of the line as unit, and though a great many were identified, they could never be
      reduced to a satisfyingly small number of basic types, as in Sievers. But Scripture's work was
      a stimulus to Schramm (E428), whose method seems much more sensible. Other studies by
      Scripture: </note>

      treats the questions of "metrical rests" and equal-timed feet, concluding that "when it is
      possible for a foot in a given poem to be five times as long as another in the same poem, and
      when one foot may frequently be twice as long as another, it is obvious that the theory of
      equality of time cannot be maintained, and that the omission of light syllables is not
      compensated for by pauses." Summary of Results at the end. Readers by and large agree on the
      placement of pauses, of which a third more appear within the line than at its end.

      presents the theory of Acoustic Metrics, volume 2 the more general theory of rhythm (in prose,
      song, and verse) including a valuable chapter (5) on comparative versification, and volume 3
      the kymograph experiments on Isochrony. Verrier is the most substantial study of English
      metrics ever undertaken which attempts to apply the assumptions and methods of acoustic
      phonetics. (It is not, however, necessarily the most authoritative; Verrier has been
      criticized sharply for using too few subjects in his tests to guarantee valid results.) He
      also uses musical notation as well, though not systematically. Meter is considered a species
      of rhythm, and metrical feet, which begin with the stressed vowel, are perceptually equal if
      not objectively so. (In practice Verrier takes as equal feet that are unequal by as much as
      40%.) In fact, though the whole third volume concerns the acoustic experiments, Verrier is
      finally not committed to objective versification; the psychological theories discussed in
      volume 2 are much closer to his central conception of the subjectivity of the perpection of
      rhythm. Synopsis: "le rythme n'y est constitué que par la coincidence de l'accent avec le

      consecutive syllables in the same word may be metrically accented; (3) metrical accent in
      polysyllables must fall on lternate syllables. See the critique of Abbott's metrical system

      principles which was influential in its time. Meter is defined as "rhythm varying over a
      constancy . . . the modulated repetition of a rhythmical pattern." This principle--"rhythmical
      constancy persisting through rhythmical variation," or the variation and the norm--has become
      a central axiom of stress metrics. Yet beyond that point Abercrombie is on a shaky ledge in
      defending the old principles of "equivalence" and "substitution." He can ably distinguish
      metrical base from rhythmic norm, yet he claims that any type of foot may be substituted in
      the rhythm of a blank- verse line for an iamb in the meter because "whatever foot occurs [in
      the rhythm] represents _ _ / standing in place of it when the verse is spaced out in the
      hearing against the ideal pattern," so that any rhythm is perfectly "equivalent" to its
      metrical base. But that is nonsense--no trochaic line fits an iambic base; rhythm is not
      "equivalent" to meter, it corresponds to meter if the rules for correspondence are satisfied.
      Altogether, the book is marred by the lingering influence of Saintsbury, yet it has great
      fixity of purpose in riveting its attention on the theoretical bases of scansion. </note>

      the thinking of the literari in the early decades of the century, and his critical opus shows
      the style of the times-- elegance and generality. See chapters 3 and 5 on rhythm, sound, and
      meter. Stenberg neatly summarizies Abercrombie's view of the emergent vers libre: "Free verse
      loses rather than gains by freeing itself from metrical patterns, for metrical rhythms are
      continuous, whereas free rhythms are not. Metrical rhythm, then, lends a certain unity, as
      well as a certain heightening of emotion, that free verse and prose are not likely to have.
      Poetry can, however, exist without metre." E462 There is a retrospective by Oliver Elton,

     <note> "Metre is the arrangement into verse of definite measures of sounds, definitely
      accented. Thus the hexameter is the arrangement in lines of six equivalent quantities of
      sound, called feet, each of which consists, or has the value, of two long syllables, and is
      accented on the first syllable. . . . In English poetry, length or quantity depends almost
      entirely upon accent. Accented syllables are long, unaccented syllables short." Feet
      recognized are the iambic, trochaic, anapestic, dactylic, spondaic, and amphibrachic. Metrical
      and stanzaic forms are illustrated. Written before Schipper, Arnold's short essay is aware
      only of Guest (E543); his principles are clearly accentual, and we can see here his deliberate
      (struggling) effort to preserve the old classical terminology for the modern verse. </note>

     <note> A study narrower in scope and therefore more accessible to most students as an
      introduction to the Russian (i.e. inductive) method in metrics than the monograph by
      Tarlinskaja (E673). Bailey compiles statistics and displays his results in graphic form for
      stress placement and variation, syllabic variation, enjambement and rhyme, lexical selection,
      and stanza form in the iambic tetrameter verse of Jonson, Milton, Pope, Cowper, Blake,
      Wordsworth, Tennyson, Eliot, Auden, and Graves. In respect to rhythm the iambic tetrameter has
      undergone the greatest changes in the twentieth century; it has remained constant in the basic
      syllabic- and stress-structure of the stem of the line, in use of anacrusis, avoidance of
      contiguous unstressed ictuses, and nonmetrical stressing, but substantial changes have
      occurred in rhythmical variety and average stressing, frequency of hiatus and polysyllabic
      words (higher), and use of elision (lower). Bailey has an acute awareness of the uses and
      abuses of statistical information, and his study takes a well-modulated and effective stance
      between the rocks and the whirlpool, generalization and detail. An important direction for

     <note> Blair's Rhetoric, which had gone through over 130 editions by the turn of this century,
      offers us an excellent view of the contemporaneous conception of versification on the "lower"
      levels of pedagogy. See Lecture 38 on "Nature on Poetry--Its Origin and
      Progress--Versification," specifically pp. 324-34. Blair recognizes the difference in
      versification between the ancient and the modern languages, so that "mere quantity is of very
      little effect in English versification," and he allows "some liberty for the sake of variety"
      in the placement of accents. The general rule is for five accents and ten syllables in the
      heroic line. A long discussion of caesura-placement shows the influence of Bysshe, and remarks
      on Blank Verse and Couplet Verse conclude the lecture. Lecture 41 (vol. 2) on "The Poetry of
      the Hebrews" is also of interest, as is lecture 13 (vol. 1), "Structure of

     <note> Here he argues that Milton's extra syllables are to be elided for purposes of the meter
      but are to be spoken aloud without reduction, thereby enriching the complication of the verse.
      Even though Bridges' work on the versification of Milton may soon be superceded by Weismiller
      (E1342), his final edition of Milton's Prosody will nonetheless remain a classic. In fact, it
      may be said that the descriptive- analytical approach to metrics so extensively pursued in the
      twentieth century received its impetus chiefly from Bridges. His principles throughout
      Milton's Prosody are three: (1) his method is Inductive; (2) he conceives of the verse- line
      as consisting of a Norm and its Variations; and (3) he considers the verse of Milton to be
      essentially syllabic, and only secondarily accentual. Bridges repeatedly evidences his firm
      grasp of historical phonology, his keen attention to Milton's technic, and his wide reading in
      the history of classical versification. Part I, "On the Prosody of Paradise Lost," treats the
      counting of syllables and accents as the fundamental principles of Miltonic meter; Bridges'
      view of Miltonic elision is that syllables are to be fully realized in pronunciation but
      elided in scansion. The number and placement of accents belongs to the rhythm but not to the
      meter, since for Bridges the accentual structure of Milton's verse is only accessory, "like
      the flesh on a skeleton." He cites lines with three, four, and five accents, with inverted
      feet in each of the five positions, and with line-breaks (he eschews the term "caesura") in
      each of the nine possible positions. Part II, on PR and SA, cites instances of Milton's steady
      relaxation of the rules he followed for PL Part III, "Obsolete Mannerisms," discusses the old
      conventions for "recession of accent," spelling, and pronunciation. The newly-added Part IV,
      "On the Prosody of Accentual Verse," offers remarks on Christabel and seven rules for the
      prosody of stress verse, the joint effect of both of which is that the metrical units or
      measures in the scansion are to be "sometimes determined" by grammar (remember that stress for
      Bridges is an element of rhythm and that sentence-stress in normal speech- rhythm is partially
      determined by syntax). His scansion system marks (in accent) single and double stress and (in
      quantity) heavy, light, and short syllables in combinations producing sixteen varieties of
      feet. This account will suggest that Bridges' mind always remained a little swayed by
      classical versification, and his typology sometimes looks a bit eccentric to us. Yet he
      insisted on accurate phonetics, his ear was good, and his conception of Rules and Norms has
      had illustrious adherents later in this century. And at least one part of Milton's Prosody is
      entirely beyond cavil--the Preface: delightful wit. Discussion of Bridges' work may be found
      in Prince (E1279), Kellog (E567), Stanford (E86, E87), Diekhoff (E1141), and Stall (E664).

     <note> Abstract of a paper read before the Philological Society on June 30: Bright censures the
      notions of "inversion of accent" and "substitution," which "must be corrected by a
      consideration of the secondary word-accents of the language, which are capable of ictus, and
      of the rhetoric of verse, which permits a new emphasis on words of subordinate force. . . . a
      verse must be read, or scanned, with a strict observance of the regular recurrence of the
      ictus; when the ictus is 'in conflict' with the chief word-stress, it will be marked for the
      ear by a slight increase of pitch. . . ." More imaginatively, Bright suggests that Sievers'
      Five Types may be found in modern verse, and also that "the rhythmic employment of the
      secondary word-stress as possible ictus furnishes the means for passing from an 'accentual' to
      a 'quantitative' system of versification," as in early and late Latin. </note>

     <note> For its location this essay seems unusually opaque (stylistically) and defensive
      (tonally); its purpose is a formal statement of the method of "routine scansion" ("the
      artistic effects of scansion according to rhythm-signature"), which is simply the notion that
      word-stress and sentence-stress are both controlled by ictus when words are arrayed in verse.
      To this end Bright must show how "versification in a language is intimately bound up with the
      special system of accentuation of that language," which he performs for English by showing
      that "secondary word-accent is available for verse-stress (ictus)." </note>

     <note> A student handbook: Part One gives definitions of terms and examples of meters (the four
      commonest, in line-lengths up to octameter) and sound- effects, including a chapter (4) on
      Scansion; Part Two illustrates stanza forms from couplet to sestina. Bright, Professor of
      English at Johns Hopkins and President of MLA, exerted considerable influence on the study of
      both versification and Old English early in this century, both himself (see J34, J35) and
      through the studies of his graduate students Huguenin (J133), Melton (E1018), Miller (E596),
      and Brown (E1112), though he himself curiously never undertook a work on the order of Mayor's.
      The crux of Bright's metrical theory is the secondary accent posited between the levels of
      stressed and unstressed in phonology (most conspicuous in compound nouns and other
      polysyllables) which is available in meter as either (promoted to) ictus or (demoted to)
      non-ictus depending on the contiguous stresses. Such a tripartite system was by no means new,
      but Bright augmented it with something that was, his correlate theory of "pitch-accent," a
      proposal that when the syllable under ictus is not marked by stress-prominence (as in
      "trochaic substitution") a compensating prominence by pitch or length is adduced. A further
      refinement was added by his students, called "arsis-thesis variation" (a poet's use of the
      same word twice, fairly close together, but with the stress-pattern of the word reversed the
      second time for semantic and aesthetic effect). Yet Bright's theory is not entirely free from
      ambivalences: Omond is unquestionably right to declare that he "scans wholly by accents," yet
      he also states that stresses recur at equal intervals, and syllable resolution is explained in
      terms of timing. This is the turn-of-the-century desire to have the best of both worlds. But
      note Philbrick's accusation that Miller and through him Bright was guilty of outright
      plagiarism from Alden and others (D323, pp. 276-77). Still, Bright's 3-level system is a
      significant milestone in the correlation of Phonetic to Metric, to be compared with the later
      4-level Trager-Smith structural-linguistic system. </note>

      Press, 1968. Another reprint: New York: Garland, 1971. Bysshe's is not only the most
      influential prosodic work of the eighteenth century, it is also very likely the most
      influential prosodic handbook ever written. Many times reprinted in the eighteenth century and
      probably at least skimmed by anyone with the slightest literary aspirations at all, it was the
      major source for Walker's equally ubiquitious Rhyming Dictionary of the nineteenth century, a
      book which was itself the model and source for similar works in the twentieth. Hence, a close
      simulacrum of at least part of Bysshe's handbook can be picked up in any bookstore today
      nearly three centuries later. The Art of English Poetry itself was based on (indeed virtually
      a translation of) Claude Lancelot's Quatre Traitez de Poësies, Latine, Françcoise, Italienne,
      et Espagnole (1663) and on the Preface to Joshua Poole's English Parnassus (1657 and 1677; see
      E520), respectively a treatise in comparative versification and a popular handbook of the
      seventeeth century, and it is composed of three parts: the "Rules for Making Verses" (a short
      metrical treatise), a "Collection of Agreeable Thoughts" (a commonplace book, or rough
      equivalent of our dictionary of familiar quotations), and a rhyming dictionary. Now although
      Renaissance miscellany has its analogue in our modern anthology of verse, and the rhyming and
      quotation dictionary as well as prosodic manual are not recognizable sub-genres to us, the
      "poet's handbook" has not survived in unaltered form: in Bysshe's time it occupied a position
      between those of the modern-day students handbook and the technical or theoretical study of
      versification. In our time technical or theoretical study of versification. In our time poets
      prefer to shift for themselves, finding the thought of imitating traditional forms repugnant
      to their individual talents. Bysshe's influence on metrical theory is equally significant. His
      "Rules," which was the first explicit Prosodia written in England in nearly a century, is
      responsible for reasserting a fundamental principle of English meter which had been asserted
      with equal insistence only once before, in the early Middle English period (though even then
      not by treatise but by practice), syllabism. And insofar as any modern manual includes, as
      part of its definition of English meter, stipulation of a certain number of syllables, it is
      echoing Bysshe, behind him Chaucer, and ultimately the faint and distant sounds of the
      Chansons. Indeed counting of syllables is the essential criterion of metricality in Bysshe:
      the heroic line is for him composed of ten syllables (not counting feminine endings), and all
      lines failing this standard are simply unmetrical. "The structure of our Verse . . . consists
      in a certain Number of Syllables, not in Feet compos'd of long and short Syllables. . . ." So
      runs his first sentence, an opening salvo against his nemesis Charles Gildon (E164-165). In
      order to insure strict count of syllables Bysshe is obliged to devise very elaborate rules for
      elision. After Numbers, the two criteria to be observed are "the Seat of the Accent" and "the
      Pause." Bysshe recognizes accent ("an Elevation or a Falling of the Voice," i.e., based on
      pitch) but not feet; he stipulates only that the accent must fall on the 2nd, 4th, or 6th
      syllable of the decasyllabic line so that the caesura ("Pause") will be thereby correctly
      placed--all other placements are faults to be corrected. The "Rules" also give some lesser
      attention to rhyme and other types of meters and stanzas. See the immensely informative essay
      by Culler (E517), whose scholarship is a model of thoroughness, Gabrielson (C10), and Lancelot
      (L82). </note>

     <bibl>A Treatise on Versification. London: Longmans, Green, 1878. 113 pp. </bibl>
     <note> A vigorous statement of the Accentual theory of English metrics, as concise in its texts
      as it is voluminous in footnotes (many of them drawn from the original Latin and Greek). The
      prosody of English verse is posited upon accent not upon time or quantity, there being four
      laws of accentuation: (1) every word of more than one syllable has a "Tonic accent"; it has
      (2) one and only one such accent; (3) monosyllable accent varies with the relative importance
      of the word; and (4) accent rests on the entire syllable not the vowel. Similarly, there are
      four laws of verse: (1) verse-rhythm depends on repetition of accent, which can be (2) nothing
      other than word-accent [lexical stress]; (3) "no syllable not sounded in declaimed prose
      should be sounded in verse"; and (4) hiatus must be removed by elision. The metrical accents
      falling on the even positions of the decasyllabic Heroic line may occur in any of thirty-five
      possible combinations. Conway recognizes what will later be called the Allophonic Stress
      Principle (p. 30)--i.e., that the the second of any two equally stressed syllables dominates.
      He gives an exceedingly meticulous analysis of the metrical treatment of syllables, especially
      elision; the book ends with brief remarks on hypermetrical syllables, rhyme, stanzas, the
      sonnet, hexameters, and sound. In a real sense this dense little volume could be considered an
      early work in Comparative versification, since the Romance languages are treated as a whole,
      with references to and examples from Italian and the classical languages. But English is taken
      as the unquestionable head. Philbrick (D323, pp. 274-76) accuses Conway of plagiarizing from

     <note> In the thiry-page Preface Coward approves the writing of English measures by "imitation"
      of those of the Greek and Latin Poets. In practice he never thwarts an English stress for a
      "long" syllable but he does promote and suppress his stresses rather erratically, making
      "ruine" a pyrrhic (Ë Ë ), "aeternal" a molossus (Ì Ì Ì ), "every" a tribrach, and "And bid
      the" antibacchic (Ì Ì Ë). </note>

     <bibl>A Study in English Metrics. New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1916. rpt Boston: Milford House,
      1972. 80 pp. </bibl>
     <note> Curious and interesting: Crapsey asserts that this study applies phonetics to metrical
      problems, but in fact this is a lexical-syntactic study: there are tables of data here on the
      incidence of monosyllables, disyllables, and polysyllables in nursery rhymes, Milton,
      Tennyson, Swinburne, Pope, and others. The rationale for this method is that metrics analyzes
      "units of verse-feet," and that we must similarly analyze "the basic phonetic units of
      speech--i.e., phonetic word-forms" in order to possess concrete information for the study of
      "one of the fundamental problems of verse as a whole, the relation of the word to the foot."
      Thereafter, the author works to produce a "consistent theory of English verse-structure as a
      whole" by reviewing the metrical theory of the time (Saintsbuty, Omond, Bridges, and others),
      followed by remarks on the problem of "secondary accent." The author, a poet, died in 1914. I
      must confess to finding this work surprisingly well-informed. Cf. Creek (E18). </note>

     <note> Based on his dissertation work at Yale in 1941, "Handbooks for Poets in the Eighteenth
      Century." With immense erudition Culler traces the sources, nature, and influences of Bysshe's
      enormously influential handbook (E506); indeed, it is not too much to say that Bysshe is the
      most important prosodic work produced between 1589 (Puttenham) and 1775 (Steele). Culler shows
      convincingly that Bysshe was heavily indebted to Joshua Poole's work (E520), and also that
      virtually every other poetic handbook, grammar, dictionary, rhyming dictionary, and
      commonplace book of the eighteenth century is derived, usually nearly entirely, from Bysshe.
      And through Walker's later rhyming dictionary, which also is Bysshe's progeny, he remained a
      standard source well into the twentieth century. If we remember that Bysshe meant his book as
      a reference and a handbook, not a prosodical treatise, we can obtain a rare glimpse of what
      the poets of the age took as an authority on versification, as opposed to the pronouncements
      of the scholars, the two being scarecely reconcilable at best. In terms of prosodic theory,
      however, Bysshe's influence was wholly pernicious, and quite extended. His system is entirely
      syllabic, basing meter on count of syllables instead of accents or feet. He obtained this
      system by lifting it wholesale from Claude Lancelot's 1663 French Treatise Quatre Traitiz de
      Poësies Latine, Françciose, Italienne, et Espagnole. Thus Bysshe simply attempted to force-fit
      the template of Romance prosody onto the English language, ignoring the fact that it did
      not--never could--fit, thereby perpetrating a misconception that would hold sway until the
      Romantic era (esp. Christabel). The Classical system would not fit the verse native to
      England, nor would the French, even though Bysshe could make men believe it for nearly a
      century. </note>

      (Washington). </bibl>
     <note> In contrast to all the other metrical theories of this century, Cummings' system
      conflates meter and rhythm rather than distinguishing them. In chapters 1 and 2 here a system
      for analyzing "rhythm phrases" is given which combines traditional metrics with acoustic
      phonetics under the aegis of a Gestalt theory of reader perception. The practical results are
      that in his scansions (model on p. 22; diagram of method on p. 14) he refuses to let the
      metrical divisions cut through words; he can provide no clearcut rules for scansion, and no
      discerning consistency is evident in the analysis. But in chapters 3-5 he maps out three new
      types of analysis which are sophisticated and intriguing: "extrinsic stress" analysis combines
      a marking of the phrase-boundaries with Trager-Smith stress levels, adjusted by "weighting,"
      to produce Stress Contour graphs and concomitant Transitional Features charts; "intrinsic
      stress" analysis argues that primary stresses are no more equal than syllables are in general,
      and if we establish "intrinsic vowel scales" assigning a weight to each vowel in terms of
      stress, pitch, and duration in each consonantal environment, an improved Stress Contour
      results; analysis of sound patterning can be improved if vowels and consonants are grouped by
      phonetic families in a "fusion" analysis which will reveal asymmetrical (ground) and
      symmetrical (figure) repetition as well as heightening and muting of the meter in verse-lines
      by clustering and linking of sounds. A very detailed yet expansive study. </note>

     <note> "The perception of metrical effects depends on set expectations in the mind of a reader.
      These expectations provide . . . a norm, a predisposition toward a certain patterning." A
      Gestalt approach based on the premise that the experienced reader of English poetry "tries to
      perceive a segmentation into units corresponding to iambic feet" (italics added). The authors
      argue, that is, that there is a pressure in English poetry for the reader to perceive the
      iambic line not as pairs of syllables grouped accentually, but simply segmentally--by "phrasal
      segmentation after each strong stress"--the simple grouping of pairs of syllables. "The
      English iambic tradition rests upon more than the iambic accentuation normally seen as
      characteristic of it; it rests, too, on a norm of iambic segmentation." These segments, which
      are "the basic rhythmic units in English metrical verse." the authors term rhythm-phrases;
      they serve to resolve "the demands exerted by the grammatical, the rhetorical, and the
      metrical norms." The authors explore the problems of diaeresis, without terming it so, and
      discuss various segmentations which try to resolve the conflicting pressures in various lines.
      The whole argument is ingeniously simple and intriguing even though it clearly borders on
      circularity. </note>

      compendium of choice phrases and quotations. The Preface treats mainly of the genres in poetry
      and of those things to be avoided in order to insure harmonious verses, viz.: any failure of
      "exact observation of the accent," syntactic dislocation, awkward elisions, feminine rhymes,
      near rhymes, rich rhymes, long polysyllables, and empty epithets (mere fillers). We are told

      have swept the field even if Campion's advocacy of the classical meters had been timely and
      persuasive (instead of a decade too late). With remarkable vigor D. sets about the
      construction and application of an unmatchable engine of assault, binding plain act and force
      of argument with engaging eloquence: "All verse is but a frame of wordes confinde within
      certaine measure . . . which frame of wordes consisting of Rithmus or Metrum, Number or
      Measure." And in English "accent [is] the chief Lord and graue Gouernour of Numbers." It were
      outright folly to apply the laws of one language to the verse of another; "every language hath
      her proper number or measure fitted to vse and delight," enforced and given legitimacy by
      "both Custom and Nature." (Besides, "it is but a fantastike giddinesse to forsake the way of
      other men.") "For as Greeke and Latine verse consists of the number and quantitie of
      sillables, so doth the English verse of measure and accent. . . . so that the English verse
      then hath number, measure, and harmonie in the best proportion of Musike." Daniel is even
      willing to admit that the continual reappearance of rhyme in the couplet is tiresome (his
      suggested remedy is emjambement, which he thinks "graceful"), yet he denies, adamantly, that
      Rhyme is too flimsy a support for verse (it "hath more of delight than euer bare numbers,"
      since its "known frame hath those due staies for the minde, those incounters of touch as makes
      the motion certaine, though the varietie be infinite"), or that the necessity of finding
      rhymes is any "impediment to [the poet's] conceit." Finally, he will not flinch to face
      Campion directly: "For what a doe haue we heere, what strange precepts of an Arte about the
      framing of an Iambique verse in our language, which when allis done, reaches not by a foote,
      but falleth out to be the plaine ancient verse consisting of tenne sillables or fiue feete,

      peculiarly marked" by duration, tone, or emphasis in pronunciation; each of these latter has
      been used at some time, though stress "is the only basis of versification in every modern
      language." Chapters follow on Quantity and Stress, six chapters on the (non- metrical) Pause,
      and, late, two chapters on the Hexameter. The book is actually, though, a study in conparative
      versification, since Evans' emphasis (along with his examples) falls equally on the Ancient

     <note> Fowler's metatheoretical inquiry into the components of an adequate theory of English
      meter appropriates Jakobson's pair of conceptual couples--verse design, verse-instance;
      delivery-design, delivery-instance--and adds one more, verse-type and metrical set, producing
      an ordered hierarchy: (verse) verse type verse design metrical set delivery design verse
      instance delivery instance (It will be seen that metrical set and verse instance thus
      correspond to reading design and reading instance, though Fowler does not make this explicit.)
      Each level of the heirarchy is then discussed in detail. "Verse is language with additional
      formal constraints." Verse-type is determined by the feature relevant to the verse--stress,
      quantity, or tone. Verse design is the inflexible pattern (e.g., iambic pentameter) set as
      invariant for the poem as a whole; actual variations (e.g. "trochaic substitutions") occur at
      the level of verse instance and "must not be spuriously reified" (this is a crucial nexus in
      the theory). Metrical set is "a reader's disposition, through past experience and through
      design- signals in the poem, to impose a familiar reading on any metre which does not
      absolutely forbid it." Thereafter the bulk of the essay tackles the critical and delicate
      problem of verse instance, Fowler giving a detailed account of that "whole area of descriptive
      metrics" whose responsibility is to show how a reader, operating under regular phonological
      and syntactic rules, (four such rules are given), determines which syllables in a line are
      ictic, whether or not the line is regular in number of syllables (Fowler thinks the theory of
      elision unlikely and prefers to admit extra-metrical syllables), and whether the number and
      positions of the syllables are acceptable (iambic pentameters frequently fail of five
      stresses, and reversed feet do occur). Actually "the ontology of verse instance remains
      uncertain," but since it partakes of both the objective linguistic features of the line, and
      also the reader's predisposed metrical set, the perfect pattern of the design need never be
      realized anywhere at all in a poem for it to be perceived as in that design. Fowler takes the
      position that even lines identical in syllable- count and stress-pattern are different verse
      instances, since their linguistic textures are different in many other respects. Concluding
      remarks on delivery. All this amounts to a theory of meter, as Fowler admits at the end. An
      advanced study, very dense in import and rather stiff in tone; not for students. The essay
      thoroughly substantiates its opening observation: "the verse situation is extremely complex."

     <note> The most widely disseminated student's manual of metrics available at present, the
      intent of which is not so much typological as heuristic: Fussell aims to "sensitize" students
      to the supple flexes of poetic form. But, as paradign of the perfect American consumer, he is
      more than willing to trade in precision for style, so that what this book gains in urbanity it
      more than loses in rigor. Fussell allows up to seventeen types of feet, and his scansions are
      consistently, sometimes wildly, unreliable. His theory in general is almost purely
      expressionist, even though none of the explanations of metrical effect he lists in chapter 1
      is seriously maintained by anyone anymore. Worse, he can sometimes say the most embarrassing
      things: substitutions in meter "are governed by instinct, whim or taste rather than by rule";
      Old English meter has only a limited capacity for interplay"; the volta in a sonnet "occurs
      somewhere in the white space that separates line 8 from line 9." We should expect as much from
      anyone whose theory is that "to do something to the reader is the end of poetry." Metrical
      types are enumerated in chapter 3, stanzas in chapter 7. The revised edition alters a few
      judgments, prunes the Bibliography, and adds a chapter on Free Verse, which is also separately

      Four varieties of stress are recognized--lexical, syntactic, rhetorical, and rhythmic--as well

      that it must fall on the lexical root syllable. Schipper bases English meter on stress, and
      "the measure or foot always remains the unity which is the basis of all modern metrical
      systems." Three types of rhyme are noted. </note>

      describe the quantity of every syllable, of a foot, of metre properly speaking, and of
      poetry," "quantity" is used only to satisfy the adamant Latinists, since "every syllable which
      has an acute or circumflex accent is long," based on the premise that "our prosody should not
      be yoked to the rules of Greek or Latin, but should be measured by the yardstick of our own
      rules alone." Gill produces elaborate rules for determining "quantity" from accent. Though he
      will admit rhyme in English verse, he allows it only grudgingly, citing numerous other devices
      necessary to "moderate" the "nausea or wearying" of a too-frequent use. Metrical feet

      separated from the rhythm of verse. Indeed, Grew gives the fullest collection of apposite
      examples of rhythmic "Phrasing" against the metrical "Abstract Pattern" that I have seen; his
      only failing is that he insists on keeping the old and misleading terms (monosyllabic foot,
      weak foot, spondee, pyrrhic, ionic, paeonic, inversion, substitution, equivalence) as denoting
      variations in the meter, but these are in fact variations in the rhythm against the metrical

      W. W. Skeat in one volume. London: George Bell and Sons, 1882. </bibl>
     <note> Rev: in The Gentleman's Magazine for June 1838; The Athenaeum, 1838, p. 551. See the
      critiques by Mayor (E594) and Jenkin (E299), and see E918. Under the influence of the early
      nineteenth-century revival of interest in Anglo-Saxon, Guest was encouraged to apply the
      principles of Old English verseform to the modern languages as well. The result, though
      fundamentally misconceived, is nevertheless a great early milestone in the history of English
      metrics. Against the general opinion of his time, Guest insisted that the basis of English
      meter was the succession of accents and not of time. By profession he was a philologist, not a
      literary critic, and indeed, in order to gather quotations for the first edition of this book,
      Guest was forced to copy out the great majority by hand from the original MSS themselves,
      there being no standard texts in 1838. Skeat, then, was forced to search out and verify these
      thousands of passages for the second edition. Guest's specialty, moreover, was Old and Middle
      English, a fact which insured that not only would the historical focus of the book be
      overweighted on the earliest times in our poetry, but also that he would draw his principles
      and methodology from the analogy with the Anglo-Saxon system. Thus, Guest identifies not
      "feet" but "sections" of syllable-groups as the basis of meter. He identifies twelve types of
      these sections, each type having three variants, Normal, Lengthened, and Doubly Lengthened. In
      Skeat's notation, where the capital A stands for an accented syllable and the lower-case b
      stands for an unaccented syllable, these twelve types of sections (hence rhythm-units) are: 1.
      AbA. 1l. AbAb. 1ll. AbAbb. 5. bAbA. 5l. bAbAb. 5ll. bAbAbb. 9. 9l. 9ll. bbAbA. bbAbAb.
      bbAbAbb. 2. AbbA. 2l. AbbAb. 2ll. AbbAbb. 6. bAbbA. 6l. bAbbAb. 6ll. bAbbAbb. 10. bbAbbA. 10l.
      bbAbbAb. 10ll. bbAbbAbb. 3. AbAbbA. 3l. AbAbbAb. 3ll. AbAbbAbb. 7. bAbAbbA. 7l. bAbAbbAb. 7ll.
      bAbAbbAbb. 11. bbAbAbbA. 11l. bbAbAbbAb. 11ll. bbAbAbbAbb. 4. AbbAbbA. 4l. AbbAbbAb. 4ll.
      AbbAbbAbb. 8. bAbbAbbA. 8l. bAbbAbbAb. 8ll. bAbbAbbAbb. 12. bbAbbAbbA. 12l. bbAbbAbbAb. 12ll.
      bbAbbAbbAbb. Each type may be expanded (or replicated internally) so long as its nature is
      preserved; type 5 may be either bAbA or bAbAbA or bAbAbAbA, etc. Guest also uses the colon to
      denote a caesura in the line, and an upright bar (|) to mark a preceding syllable as stressed.
      Thus Milton's "Anguish and doubt and fear, and sorrow and pain" may be scanned An| guish and
      doubt| and fear| : and sor| row and pain| and conveniently notated as 2:5. Structurally, the
      History of English Rhythms is divided into four Books: the first defines syllable, accent,
      quantity, rime, and pause; the second gives illustrations of each of the twelve rhythmic
      types, the third is a history of stanza forms. In many respects not even Saintsbury's
      three-volume History (A8) can rival the erudition, clarity, industry, and graceful tone of
      Guest's treatise, and though his system seems to us an odd one, it is easy to learn and use.
      As Henry James said in another place, the book "supports familiarity"; it will not weary the
      reader soon, as Saintsbury will. Though Guest's direct influence has been slight in the
      century after his work was first published, his Accentualist principles have pretty much won
      the field. Guest's system has been applied only by T. R. Price (E1278), however. </note>

      an iamb, monosyllabic foot, trochee, dactyl, and an anapest. </note>

     <note> In a brilliant codification of the traditional concepts of English meter, Halpern shows
      that a more compelling distinction than that between stress meter and syllable-stress meter in
      English is the one between "the entire iambic tradition and all English verse written in
      strong-stress meter, whether syllable-counting or not." In iambic verse the important
      differences of stress between syllables are relative, within the two-member metrical foot
      (this is the Relative Stress Principle), whereas in all the other meters the differences are
      absolute. (I.e., in iambic verse, metrical foot demarcation precedes metrical stress
      assignment, whereas in the other meters metrical stress assignment follows directly from the
      linguistic stresses: the strong are strong and the weak weak). This explains our comon
      sensation that the beats in trochaic in the ternary meters are so "clear and emphatic" in
      comparison with the unstressed syllables, while they are not so in iambic meter: in iambic
      verse the gradations are modulated. The trochaic the ternary meters, like simple stress verse,
      are isoaccentual and isochronic (iambic verse is neither), but unlike stress verse, which
      achieves some modulation by varying the number of syllables, these meters, having a regular
      syllable-count, lose modulation altogether, which explains why we cannot bear them for
      extended runs. In iambic verse the only permissible variations are the addition or deletion of
      a syllable or reversal of a foot. </note>

      A survey of metrical forms in English verse, with copious examples. Hamer's metrical
      principles are accentual (three degress of stress are identified--strong, mid, and weak), but
      no clear distinction is made between either (1) rhythm and meter, or (2) stress verse and
      syllable-counting verse, with this result: the four commonest feet are denoted the rhythmic
      base, with some twelve other feet admissible as modulations: stressed and unstressed
      monosyllabic feet, major and minor ionics, pyrrhics and spondees, choriambics, tribrachs,
      amphibrachs, bacchics, antibacchics, and second paeons. The result, predictably, is that
      Hamer's scansions are wildly unreliable. But the book offers four chapters on the evolution of

      accentual poetry. Herbert argues that Greek speech and verse had tonic (stress) accents as
      well as quantity and that English stress does not lengthen a syllable (contrary to Foster,
      Sheridan, and Kames). On the modern accentual hexameters he observes keenly that since
      classical verse had both accent and quantity, to replace the one by the other is not to
      reproduce or even achieve an analogous effect but to confound, conflate, and wreck the
      original meter. The modern Romance meters were "not modern inventions, but the old accentual
      laws of Latin verse, which survived those of quantity." English meter is based on "accentual
      feet," one stress to the foot, but quantity "neither is, not ought to be entirely
      disregarded"; in fact, since many links have seven, eight, or nine long syllables, "variety of
      quantity is rather to be sought for than restricted." </note>

     <note> Omond did not see this work, which, for its rather insular position, shows some
      unexpected perception. Humphrey identifies the qualities of sound in orthoepy (pronunciation)
      as accent ("stress of voice"), cadence (absence of stress), emphasis (rhetorical or sentential
      stress), tone (intonation, pitch), time, and quantity. Quantity is "the weight, or aggregate
      quantum of sounds, either longer or shorter" and thereby "differs materially from time: time
      only determines the length of sounds." Though these are two distinct entities, they both
      inhere in verse-structure; "they are both affected by accent and cadence, but quantity more
      than time, and quantity more than time also constitutes numbers." Humphrey realizes that
      though time was the origin for quantity in ancient Greek verse, quantity is in essence an
      abstract concept, and though it was called long and short in Greek, it would be more
      accurately termed "great and small quantity" in English. In short, he recognizes the hegemony
      of accent, even though the old terms are preserved. Twelve types of feet are allowed, five of
      them denoted as commonest. Rules for scansion and also for reading are given. The remainder of
      this little book treats stanzaic forms. </note>

      long, short, or indifferent) without any deeper inquiry, and the only indication that he takes
      accent to determine quantity--and hence confounds accent with quantity--appears early on, when
      the versifier is enjoined to "ryme ay to the hinmest lang syllable (with accent) in the lyne"
      as in "byte and flyte, because the lenth of the syllable, and accent being there." None of his
      quantities violates accent. The rules for rhyme, sectioun (caesura), fitting of the words into
      the meter, stanzas, comparisons, and Inventions are all familiar enough; of interest are his
      terms flowing (for steady or smooth rhythm) and Literall and Tumbling verse (the former the
      old Alliterative line, the latter in anapests and said to be best for flyting (invective)).

     <note> The substance of the treatise Dryden said he had prepared may be reconstructed by
      examining his scattered critical statements on: prosody (a body of mechanical rules); the
      functions of poetry (first to delight, then to instruct); the sources of delight in poetry
      (chiefly the versification itself); qualities of good verse (smoothness, variety, vigor);
      quantity [Jameson is obscure here]; measure (= verse, or line?). number (of syllables per
      foot, perhaps of syllables per line); feet (based on accent and strictly disyllabic); cadence
      (rhythm); pause (caesura?); synaloepha (to be eschewed); rhyme; and stanza. In constrast to
      Bysshe's, Dryden's metric is based on accentual (disyllabic) feet). </note>

      classic of early, clear-sighted argumentation in metrics: Jesperson's insights here are at
      least half a century ahead of their time. He attacks the "permissible substitutions" or
      "variations against the norm" theory of meter, showing it does not explain the facts. He
      rejects the idea of the metrical foot and of only two degrees--Stressed or Weak--in English
      meter, preferring himself four degrees of metrical stress. He asserts the Relative Stress
      Principle--the metrically relevant differences in stress are only relative not absolute. He
      acknowledges the Pause as metrically important and devises an entirely new scansion system to
      show the rises and falls between syllables in the [pentameter] line: a / b \ a / b \ a / b \ a
      / b \ a / b From our vantage, the whole essay remains unwavering in its strength and
      directness: the questions are the hard ones, the position taken is argued simply and clearly,
      the exemplification is adequate to its purpose. In metrics we are not very often in the
      presence of a first-order mind. See Minaishi (E597), and see L413. </note>

      Lord Kames is the voice of l'ancien régime: he prefers to speak of quantities, and though he
      recognizes the existence of accent, he thinks it can be dispensed with on the grounds that
      "accenting is confined to the long syllables." He allows thirty-four types of feet. The
      inquiry into verse-structure is ordered on the consideration of number, quantity, and
      arrangement of syllables, pause, (caesura-placement receives a very long treatment), and
      accent. He identifies four types of the heroic line (by the caesura after the fourth, fifth,
      sixth, or seventh syllable) but at the end comes finally to prefer Miltonic blank verse.
      Though the substance in this chapter is errant in many ways, the style is refreshingly clear,

      English verse since the Renaissance, the tradition which Bridges' theory of elision entails
      and confirms, in opposition to the Saintsbury heresy, "trisyllabic substitution." The syllabic
      metrical theory at the center of Milton's practice, as described by Bridges, is nearly
      identical to that set forth in the verse-manuals of the Italian Renaissance (e.g. Minturno's),
      which were themselves descriptions of the syllabic meters of such poets as Trissino. These
      four writers--two poets, two prosodists--represent the four most crucial figures in a metrical

      Greek and Latin had. But Greek speech was more like our song, the two being separated later,
      so that "the present meaning of the word accent bears no relation to its original use." In
      classical times speech was "a kind of song," but we have lost this "chaunt of accent" (i.e.,
      tone). In classical verse, accent and quantity did not coincide; neither do they in modern
      verse. Stress "supplies the place of" length for us. The term "feet" he rejects in favor of

     <author>La Drière, J. Craig.</author>
     <bibl>"Prosodic Notation." Princeton (A18), pp. 667-69. </bibl>
     <note> Identifying three possible notation systems for marking the suprasegmental features of
      speech (by diacritical markings; by complete graphic transcription, either phonetic or
      phonemic; or by an "abstract schematic symbolism"), La Drière supports the third system as
      being value-free, applicable to all languages, and restricted to the rhythmic features of
      interest. Various sorts have been tried, using as symbols (1) letters of the alphabet
      (Verrier, Stewart), (2) numbers, to mark intensity or position or both (Mayor, Lotz, Croll),
      (3) musical notation (Gildon, Lanier), or (4) arbitrary graphic markers (Steele, Skeat,
      Thomson, Heusler, and La Drière himself). The author's own system, employed in the following
      article, is explained: the syllable is abstractly symbolized as o, with diacritical marks for
      four degrees of stress and hovering stress, the comma for breaks between stress-groups, and
      the subscript caret for longer pauses. Marks for primary, secondary, tertiary, and weak accent
      (respectively): ó ò o oo. Hovering primary-secondary uses a hacek over the o. La Drière's
      system also differentiates group cadence [the rhythmic or phrasal groups of stresses
      determined by syntax], general cadence [meter, in effect], and measure [balance within the
      line and equalization between lines]. This system will also be found employed in the
      subsequent studies by Barry (E1448), Dougherty (D272), Holloway (E914), and Berg (E950). A
      more conventional scansion system is described in Princeton s.v. "Scansion," pp. 740-41.

      are analyzed, with results in tabular form. This sort of "grammetrics" is unquestionably both

      they are only more or less useful. The meter of a poem must be found by the norm of the entire

     <note> Rev: in Southern Review 3 (1967): 441-43; see also Pyle (E618). Chapter 1 presents the
      basic concepts of Meter: the fundamental unit of versification is the line; the metrical foot
      consists of a cluster of slacks around a single stress; monosyllabic feet are possible,
      therefore, but not pyrrhics or spondees; and speech-stresses vary in degree but are reduced to
      only two levels in meter. Chapter 2 treats Variation: substitution and elision, changes of
      line- length, and changes of meter. But it is the crucial Chapter 3 where the author reveals
      his excellent design for "exhibiting the essential duality of our experience of the line" by a
      double-tiered scansion system; but showing the actual rhythm above the paradigmatic meter, he
      can display cogently all the subtle effects of each against the other and the resultant
      scansion of the line. Chapter 4 treats the influence of meter on performance; 5,
      sound-patterning; 6, Accentual, Syllabic, and Free meters; followed by a Glossary. McAuley's
      handbook is easily the best text available for teaching metrics, and beyond that is one of the
      sanest things ever written on English versification. Nowhere is the distinction between the
      spheres of meter and rhythm--and the resultant "interanimations" of the two--better displayed.

     <note> More useful than the conception of meter as an abstract form--i.e., as container, or
      else one element contained--is the conception of meter as organic form, as a force for order
      within "a coherence of activities," "a system of dynamics," the poem. Within that dynamos
      energy is balanced against tension, so that the poem moves by "an accommodation of movement to
      the resistances against it," the antinomian forces generating "form" by their constructive and
      vitalic oppositions. Over all of these stands the impassive Meter, making its subtle Authority
      manifest only through the body of the lines, creating an immanent fixity and stricture of rule
      which is the paradoxical source of a nearly infinite range of variation. Throughout every
      supple or sudden divagation, underneath every gesture of hand or voice, nearly behind the
      field of view in every image, the form of the poem speaks Constancy, promises Order, satisfies
      Expectation, indeed nearly convinces us that all is for the best and that the poet is really
      very sane. </note>

     <bibl>"The Native Rhythm of English Meters." Texas Studies in Literature and Language 5 (1964):
      580-94. </bibl>
     <note> A remarkable effort at synthesizing the entire history of English metrics into a single
      cogent interpretation that can be demonstrated within a very small compass: Malof's thesis is
      that the native English verseform, the old four-stress line, and the more complex foreign
      form, the (syllable-counting) pentameter line, have developed side by side, neither one very
      far from the other, throughout the entire history of English poetry: "the old native rhythm
      runs through much of our pentamenter verse, providing a basis for a continual modulation of
      counterpoint." Indeed, what one may say of the Romantic revolution and of the verse of the
      twentieth ventury, as of the late Shakespeare, is that the foreign verseform may "take over
      momentarily and denaturalize the native line, but that in time the native element reasserts
      itself and renaturalizes the line, transforming the foreign element into something new as it
      does so." In any period of crisis or uncertainty the sturdier native form will resurface.
      There is, then, a fundamental ambiguity between stress verse and foot verse; they permeate
      each other yet seem somewhat immiscible, so that much English verse more or less qualifies as
      either; the great success of our poetry has been to hold them both in solution together,
      productively. </note>

     <note> Mason intends to scan by quantity, as he constructs verse of "time, syllables, feet, and
      measures," yet he is utterly undone by the confusion of quantity with accent. Though an
      unaccented syllable is naturally Short, he says, "yet if it be Accented in the Ordinary Way of
      Pronunciation, or the Sense requires the Emphasis to be laid on it, it becomes a long
      Quantity." He recognizes four disyllabic feet, eight trisyllabic, and sixteen tetrasyllabic,
      These last are formed of combinations of the disyllabic types and called "Dipodies"; whenever
      the two simple feet are dissimilar, they are termed a "Syzygy." More interesting historically,
      though, is the conjunction of poetic measure and music made in chapters 7 and 8. It is fair to

     <note> A good many of us could go to school here: Maxwell's thesis is metrical
      counterpoint--that effect wherein "every reader of poetry is quite well aware of two
      movements, the first a pattern borne in mind, the second a speech movement which, whether in
      identity or variation, is related to it, though a momentary forgetfulness of the relationship
      is possible and sometimes pleasing." His point, more specifically though, is "a clear
      distinction between the sort of feet which may compose the basic pattern [the meter] and those
      which may be introduced by way of variation [in speech]. The second sort may be made up in
      almost any way" [italics added]. Thus each syllable of Tennyson's line "Break, break, break"
      is a foot in the second system but not in the first. "The principle to be observed is that the
      basic pattern must always determine the number of metrical divisions" rather than the
      actualized variations. The reader of verse, then, feels "the need to follow two movements at
      once," yet surprisingly the effort produces not an added difficulty, but "a curious grace."
      That is the pleasure we take in the lines of accomplished actors. </note>

      1912; rpt New York: Lemma Publications, 1972. </bibl>
     <note> Rev: By Gummere in MLN 2 (1887): 159-62. One of the lesser-known monuments of late
      Victorian metrics, but likely second only to Schipper (A9) in scope, method, and significance.
      Saintsbury said that "had Mr. J. B. Mayor's Chapters on English Metre been fuller, I had
      hardly written this book. . . . an unsound criticism is rare, an unsound scansion rarer."
      Unfortunately, though, Mayor compiled the book not by writing out his views on metrics
      directly but by collecting five essays he had previously published reviewing the major
      metrists who had preceded him--Guest, Abbott, Symonds, Ellis, Bridges, and Skeat (chapters 2,
      3, 4, 5, and 7 of Chapters respectively), four essays on the history of Blank Verse (chs.
      10-13), an essay on Shelley's meters (see E1017), and a chapter on the Hexameter, adding for
      the book publication only an Introduction, two Appendices, (the first on the Old French
      decasyllable, with an abstract of Zarncke's obscure monograph (L658), the second listing the
      terminology of classical versification), and two new essays on metrical classification
      (chapters 8 and 9). Thus we are forced to find Mayor out by indirections, watching his theory
      unfold in his reactions to the critical minds around him. That theory scans verse entirely by
      accent (Mayor thinks the concept of quantity very nearly ludicrous) but views the line as
      comprising metrical feet, not merely syllables. This position, the stress-and-foot theory, has
      become virtually High Orthodox in the century since Mayor's book. He is willing to retain the
      classical nomenclature (for convenience's sake), but oddly, he seems to think that the
      function of the metrist is to discover and categorize all the variations on strictly regular
      meter that are to be found in a poet's lines--ascending or descending, disyllabic or
      trisyllabic, truncated, hypermetrical, or downright irregular. In retrospect, that function
      seems necessary as a preliminary to the interpretation and criticism but worse than pedantic
      as an end. Mayor recognizes three degrees of stress, and he uses the 0, 2, 3 system of Ellis
      (C9) to mark them in scansions. Halpern (E546) believes that Mayor recognized the Relative
      Stress Principle in the 1870's, nearly thirty years before Jesperson. On Guest, Mayor
      demonstrates in too painful detail the easy recognition that his system is entirely perverse:
      to believe that the Old English prosody of "sections" (halflines) is the authentic metric of
      all English poetry up to the present is indeed to find that by such a system all the best
      modern poets have been bunglers and gross incompetents. So Guest's system, ponderously
      cumbersome, misrepresents those lines that it does not misunderstand. The accent-based metric
      of Edwin Abbott (E458) Mayor thinks the "true and natural" approach, though his distinction of
      word-accent, metrical- accent, and emphasis creates some needlessly complicated rules for
      assigning metrical ictus. Mayor argues for pyrrhics and spondees. In the case of A. J. Ellis's
      system, however, the complications are compounded beyond all reason. Hoping to avoid the very
      nebulous terms "accent" and "emphasis," Ellis distinguishes between force, length, pitch,
      weight, and silence in syllables, allowing a scale of nine degrees of gradation for each
      feature, each of the degress having an individual descriptive term--e.g. "superheavy,"
      "sublong," "supershort"--producing, thus, forty-five terms altogether. Mayor can only "with
      difficulty repress a shudder at the elaborate apparatus he has provided for registering the
      minutest variations of metrical stress." The concept of weight is also questionable. Three
      other theorists are reviewed: Symonds (E1320) is censured for the dilettantism of his
      "intuitivism"; Bridges is judged by setting his theory of stress meter in Milton (E491)
      against his own work in The Feast of Bacchus and Nero, where its neglect of syllable-counting
      results in ineffective description (notice that Mayor's concern with syllable-counting,
      though, leads him in chapter 9 to a total misunderstanding of Hymn Meters); and Skeat (E646)
      is found confused and unnatural, his groupings of syllables around an accent more a matter of
      rhythm than of meter. Chapter 6, however, deserves final attention: there Mayor elaborates his
      method--which is, simply put, Empiricisim--in an attempt to arbitrate alternative scansions of
      problem lines. Two principles emerge: the prevailing context will control our scanning of any
      given line, and in general the range of permissible variations for a meter can be stated. But
      this sort of statement (p. 91) turns out to be rather unpleasantly extended and qualified,
      allowing only a cautious general rules: "one or two unaccented syllables preceding the initial
      accent or following the final accent of the line are non-essential to the rhythm." Such a
      result must surely cast doubt over the utility if not the validity of the method. </note>

     <note> Rev: in the Critical Review 38 (1774): 137-43; by Herbert in the Edinburgh Review (see
      E550). Quite possibly our earliest English effort at a comparative versification for the
      modern languages as well as for the ancient. I treat the second edition here; the 1774 Essay
      was directed against Foster, but the Inquiry retracts a bit in favor of more general
      principles. For Mitford, harmony in language is the result of the combination of measure and
      melody. Accent or Tone he considers the result of both force (loudness, in three degrees) and
      higher pitch. "Emphasis" is rhetorical accent. Syllabic quantity is recognized--in regard to
      both long and short vowels and long and short syllables--as is length by position: a short
      vowel followed by two distinct consonants makes the syllable long. But Mitford is careful not
      to confound accent and quantity: stress does not lengthen syllables. The "rhythmus or cadence"
      of English speech is compared to music, but even though he can speak of "the identity of
      poetical and musical measures," in general he considers the relation of verse to music to be
      one of analogy. Verse, like music, runs in either common or triple time, the beats beginning
      the bars and hence disposed isochronously in relation to each other. Yet when Mitford comes to
      scansions, no musical apparatus is anywhere in sight: the accents end the iambic measures
      rather than begin them, and though quantities are marked throughout (virtually all syllables
      turn out to be long, of course), they clearly have no relation to the stressing. He recognizes
      that the irregularities of syllabic quantity are such that "the disposition of long and short
      quantities cannot be the foundation of that order which constitutes the order of verse." And
      "as the arrangement of music in bars has been decided by the convenience of the musical
      performer without any consideration of the competition of music with poetry, so the
      arrangement of the syllables in verse in feet should be decided by the convenience of metrical
      analysis, without regard to those divisions which music has established for its own separate
      purposes." In short, Mitford scans by accent alone, regardless of the theoretical
      genuflections he makes to the musical ideas of the day. (Elsewhere he calls accent "not the
      constituent but the indicant only of measure.") That order which does constitute the verse in
      English is one wherein "the alternate syllables are acuted." Permissible "aberrations of
      accent" include the doubling, absence, and reversal of the stress in the foot, and extra
      syllables are to be admitted as trisyllabic substitutions rather than removed as elisions
      (perspicuously, Mitford sees that "the poetical or metrical syllable is not precisely the same
      with the grammatical syllable" in some cases). Section 3 treats Quantity, 4 Accent, and 5
      Cadence. Section 6 offers his theory of the mechanism of English verse. Section 7 on the
      history of English versification is also of interest. Summary (curious and interesting), pp.
      108-9. Mitford is a landmark in the history of English versification. (Fussell's treatment of
      Mitford (E34) is inconsistent and confused; he finds there both strict syllabism and
      "anti-syllabism" (pp. 33 and 150).) </note>

     <note> See chapters 4-6 of Book 2, and chapter 8 of Book 3, in volume 2. Monboddo's tediously
      repetitive treatise shows the great promise of a rigorous distinction between quantity and
      accent, until one recognizes that by "accent" he means pitch, not stress--an "acute or grave"
      quality of the voice, as opposed to "loud or soft" or "long or short." The Classical Greek
      language he holds to have been regulated by this "accent," not quantity--"the antient accents
      are real notes of music, or variations of the tone, by which the voice is raised higher. . .
      ." Such "accents" he denies exist in modern English (p. 298 ff); we have changes of tone, well
      enough, "but upon words or sentences . . . not upon syllables," and they admit of no rule.
      Thus Monboddo can back into the truth: "in English, syllabical accents . . . are of a quite
      different kind from the antient accents; for there is no change of the tone in them; but the
      voice is only raised more, so as to be louder upon one syllable than another. . . . the music
      of our language [is] in this respect nothing better than the music of a E602 drum, in which we
      perceive no difference except that of louder or softer. . . ." This last remark thereafter
      became one of the clichés of the day. Chapter 5 on Quantity is sensible: M. refuses to
      acknowledge length by position, accepting only (1) vowels naturally long or (2) diphthongs.
      Classical verse is ordered on the basis of such quantities, but these are quite extraneous to
      English meter (pp. 325-26). English verse, "as a species of rhythm" requires "both louder and
      softer sounds . . . and these must return at equal intervals, or such as have some other ratio
      to one another, otherwise, there is no verse." "There is however something more required to
      complete the verse; and that is, a certain number of syllables" (pp. 384-85). Added to this is
      only the "infinite variety" of quantity in English verse, and the definition is complete. The
      rest consists of approbation of Blank Verse and of Milton. Background reading: C. D. Abbott's

     <note> Hoping to reverse the widening gap between literature and linguistics so apparent in
      versification, Pace suggests that the relation between traditional and structural metrics is
      exactly the same as that between meter and rhythm. Traditional metrics treats of "gross stress
      contrasts," by reducing all the minute degrees of stressing to one binary opposition. Meter in
      these terms is little more than a highly simplified recognition pattern. Structural metrics,
      on the other hand, describes more degrees of stressing, pitch, juncture, and other linguistic
      features, and as it increases its specificity of description it approaches the limiting case
      of one single realization (performance). This is the wide and various domain of rhythmics. But
      though we say a poem has a meter we cannot say it has a rhythm; it actually has "a rhythm
      potential (all readings) and a rhythm core (the best readings)." Thus, a Trager-Smith notation
      of a poem's rhythm core amounts to "a prescription for an ideal performance." Intonational
      ambiguities (which pertain to rhythm not meter) might be retained unresolved but would be
      better normalized. Contrast Pace's relegation of intonation to the domain of rhythm with
      Crystal's resolute inclusion of it in the domain of meter (E20). </note>

      stress placement causes the verse to "labor under a deficit" (Pemberton is strict to the point
      of severity), metrical variation is deplorable in general except for verse-paragraphing, and
      trochaic substitutions are a license "least offensive" in first position. Music is often
      mentioned by Pemberton as the rationale for a practice, e.g. not mixing measures. He praises
      Milton and Glover. The heavy influence of Bysshe is obvious, though Pemberton's definitions of
      metre and rhythmus are noteworthy historically. </note>

     <note> (See esp. pp. lxiv-lxxiii in the Introduction on versification.) Puttenham's is the most
      extensive and important English treatise on verse- making, and also possibly the first; the
      latest editors present strong evidence of stratification in the text, the earliest draft of
      the Arte being written perhaps as early as 1569 and thus antedating both Ascham and Gascoigne.
      Puttenham made revisions steadily thereafter until the mid-Eighties, when there was a
      wholesale reworking of Book 3 and the last six chapters of Book 2. Thus the book was
      apparently twenty years in the making. Book 2 on "Proportion" is the one for us; Book 1 treats
      matter, Book 3, figures. In the first twelve chapters of Book 2 we find an earlier Tudor view
      of metrics, in contrast to the later (considerably altered) views expressed in the last six
      chapters on classical meters. In the early conception, Puttenham describes Greek and Latin
      verse as having Meters in Feet, which he denies in the vulgar languages; English is ruled
      solely by Number (syllabic regularity) and Rime (also termed cadence, or concord of tunable
      sound). To the modern way of thinking these seem too insignificant criteria, and we are
      surprised to see Puttenham making much of Rime, especially, but that is our own tinted vision.
      He also speaks often of Accent, but ambiguiously (p. 82 in Smith), seeming to mean by that
      term mostly pitch rather than stress; he also speaks of "motion and stir" and "times," but
      these too are hazy: "Meter and measure . . . [lie] with us in the number of syllables, which
      are comprehended in every verse, not regarding his feete. . . . by reason of the evident
      motion and stir which is perceived in the sounding of our words not always equal, for some ask
      longer, some shorter time to be uttered in." Thus Puttenham's (early) explanation for the
      inapplicability of classical versification rests on a (not very clear) argument about
      polysyllabicity vs. monosyllabicity; perhaps this is simply a confused realization that the
      times for producing English syllables are too infinitely graded to be classed either long or
      short. At one crucial point (p. 76 in Smith) Puttenham realizes that a line scans badly (weak
      iambs verge on dactyls) but cannot win his way to the right explanation. He does not
      understand Accent very clearly nor certainly in the modern sense of the term but he does
      perceive a cutting difference in the vernacular and the classical versifications. The bulk of
      the Arte is given over to his famous illustrations of staffe (stanza, by which he means
      line-lengths plus rhyme-schemes, the rhymes exerting a band or binding force), both for ear
      and eye, with a long digression on kingship. Chapter 13 and 18 (corrected numbering) do indeed
      "say otherwise" and "seem contradictory," but the reference to classical meters as
      "scholastical toys" suggests a tone not entirely serious. And the strategy Puttenham is
      suggesting is indeed a clever one, designed to solve a conceptual problem by semantic
      sleight-of-hand, or casuistry. All of the "auncient feete" may be introduced into convenient
      and agreeable use, "according with our ordinary times and pronunciation," by a simple means,
      which is "to allow every word polisillable one long time of necessitie, which should be where
      his sharp accent falls in our owne ydiome most aptly and naturally. . . ." In short, quantity
      will be abstracted to the sense of ictus and filled in the lines by stress rather than length.
      No Law of Position will be allowed for English, since Puttenham believes that its
      justification even in Latin rests on nothing but "bare tradition." Of "auncient feet" he will
      allow twelve. In a moment of candor, though, he can confess that "in very truth I thinke [my
      remarks] but vaine and superstitious obseruations nothing at all furthering the pleasant
      melody of our English meeter . . . and rather wish the continuance of our old manner of
      Poesie, scanning our verse by [count of] sillables rather than by feete. . . ." Finally, note
      the half-confused conception of "breaking" in chapter 18; this is a groping realization that
      the metrical value of English syllables depends on where they are deployed in the line, rather
      than inhering in the syllable per se by definition, as in classical verse. Thus the shifting
      of words one slot over in the line will "break" an iambic rhythm into a trochaic. Puttenham
      grasps, dimly, that rhythm reinforces meter most strongly when word- and foot- boundaries
      coincide, though he admits he does not know why (p. 138 in Smith; see also pp. 130-31). Two

     <note> What are the minimum conditions required for a ten-syllable line to be perceived as
      "iambic," i.e. metrical? Some theorists have claimed that stresses on the fourth and sixth
      syllables of the decasyllabic line are sufficient, and Pyle shows that by shifting the whole
      line (and its stress-pattern) right or left under the metrical grid a fit can be obtained and
      the principle verified. The fourth or sixth position must be weighted, and if the eighth is
      weighted the tenth need not be, but if it is not then the ninth must be, in order to insure
      that a line will not be judged positively unmetrical, though for it to be judged positively
      metrical, more complex rules are required (pp. 122-24). (These are extended and simplified in

      (projected). The second installment is in Counterpoint, no. 3 (1977), pp. 3-6. Radavitch
      observes (correctly) that the traditional bivalent scansion system of metrics cannot express
      (or account for) certain kinds of information in the poetic line. (This observation raises the
      larger theoretical question of what kinds of features a metrical system should be designed to
      denote at all, though this question is unfortunatelynot explored here.) Radavitch then
      proposes an alternative scansion sysem with eight degrees of stress, indicated by numerical
      superscripts from 1 (weakest) to 8. (Note that this system doubles the members of each of the
      four categories in Trager-Smith.) He believes that "poetic stress" is a composite of four
      stresses: metrical, lexical, durational, and line-pattern. A middle section presents the
      differences between Music and Metrics (he is aware that the eight levels of the metric could
      correspond to the musical octave) and then applies the "numerical notation" to indicating
      pitch-patterns in musical lines (the confusions of this section are as instructive as its
      conclusions). Two sections explore four kinds of "governing rules" or "grammars" of the poetic
      line: these are rules of language, poetry, the poet, and the line itself; violation produces
      "language syncopation" (otherwise known as metrical variation). Concluding analysis of
      Stevens' "Anecdote of the Jar." Altogether, the exposition and terminology seem luxuriant. It
      would seem that the few criteria for "poetic stress" are so broad as to nearly eliminate any
      consensus on a correct scansion of a line, given the eight degrees of stress. But the author
      believes that a computer could be programmed to perform scansions automatically. </note>

     <note> Paraphrase of the refulgent passage on pp. 268-69 seems a transgression. Ransom

      "abstract meter with a simple repetitive rhythm," the "pure vocables," but at times this
      metrical pattern "must accommodate itself to the logical pattern of the words," and if at that
      point "some brilliant and perspicuous prose rhythm" can be found to overlay the simple meter,
      then the poet will have achieved a "counterpoint . . . the very special aural beauty of a
      metered work." But at the same time "the meaningful or signifying patterns of the words intend
      to be fully logical," but when the meter interferes, other words will have to be found. This
      might seem a shortcoming, "but often we feel that the greatest glory of the poem turns on its
      individual phrases when they conflict with but accommodate themselves to the meter. They will
      have come to their present form after much trial and error; and the successive versions will
      have been tested for their substantive brilliance as well as for their capacity for making
      oral counterpoint." </note>

      thought it was respecting the meters, were ceasing to function, and the meters did not know
      their own importance. Meters activated, as they are when the metaphysicals use them, seem at
      first to be restrictive, and obstructive, upon the flow of language, but actually they are
      what makes the phrases shine." </note>

      how such sequences may be combined and how phrasal-stress patterns are adjusted when discrete
      phrases or words are marshalled together into meter, and finally rules to show when such
      sequences will be metrically admissible. He retains the concept of the metrical foot. His
      catagories of "stress-fixed" and "stress-shifting" metrical schemas sould like echoes of
      Chatman's "meter-fixed" and "meter-fixing" (E713), but one other distinction he makes is I
      think original and important: "for homomorphic metric schemes the conception of the foot break
      is prior to the conception of the line break, and the line breaks will respect the foot
      breaks. For non-homomorphic metric schemes, on the other hand, the line break is prior to the
      foot break and scansion can only occur once the line is determined." This merits "unpacking,"

      of English poetry as a whole, and to discover, if possible, in what way it was constructed. I
      found . . . that a system of syllabic equivalence and substitution composing, and equating or
      contrasting, different prosodic units for which I kept the old traditional name of feet
      pervaded the whole of it. . . . Into the origin and nature, as distinguished from the
      contrasted value and arrangement, of long and short syllables I did not enter, beyond pointing
      out that neither accent, nor stress, nor except in a purely differential sense, quantity,
      would account for it satisfactorily. By differential, I mean that things of one kind were
      short, and those of another long, with an occasional faculty of change usually called
      commonness. And there was an end to it. (Some Recent Studies (E643)) Such a statement of
      principles--it is a relatively accurate self-assessment- -is dismaying, to say the least. As a
      serious method for intellectual inquiry, it seems to simply disdain all rational, orderly,
      self-conscious method. The judgment of it given by T. S. Omond (himself an opinionated but
      nevertheless a scrupulously fair critic) is not extreme: I think most readers of his volumes
      will share my surprise at the resolute way in which their author declines to discuss the
      phenomona which he chronicles. . . . He talks of "long" and "short" syllables, without saying
      what they mean, and says he might as well have called them "abracadabra and abraxas." His
      scansions are a glorious higgledy-piggledy of iambs and trochees, or dactyls and anapests,
      without any clue as to how these can be interchangeable. He not only does not know how feet
      are constituted, but he resolutely refuses to inquire. His really reckless use of the terms
      "long" and "short" with deliberate avoidance of their meaning leads him into terrible pitfalls
      when he comes to deal with quantitative verse. . . . Matchless as an historian of our verse,
      as an analyst he is not only nought but wishes to be so. No adequate account of our
      verse-structure is to be found in these otherwise admirable volumes. (A5, pp. 250-51) It may
      be said, then, by way of synopsis, that whenever Saintsbury found himself in a tight place,
      and forced to explain himself fairly clearly, he always (forgive me) took to his feet. His
      metrical treatise adopts, wholesale, almost shamelessly, the old classical terminology of
      Longs and Shorts, and the scanning of verse in feet. For the study of classical verse, this
      apparatus had already been in use for over two milennia before Saintsbury's time, though as
      applied to the versification of English it had been a demonstrable source of confusion--and
      generally discredited--for over three centuries when Saintsbury took it up so fiercely. His
      theory treats its constituents, Quantity and the Foot, as utter abstractions, mere counters,
      not requiring the slightest natural explanation. "'Does length,' some people ask, 'really mean
      "duration of time" in pronouncing?' This question, and others, seem to the present writer
      unnecessary." So it is not vowel-length that determines quantity, nor will Saintsbury allow
      any Law of Position. His Foot Theory will have nothing to do with any Temporalist notions
      either, as witnesses his critique of Lanier (A8, vol. iii, pp. 493-97). Yet at the same time
      he confesses "of the isochronous interval" that "I believe in it myself, though I prefer to
      economise letters and call it a 'foot,'" (III, 439-40), and he does accept the concepts of the
      monosyllabic foot and the metrical pause, indeed to the point of allowing feet entirely filled
      by pauses, which in any syllable- and stress-counting metric is impossible. But the
      Accentualists suffer worse at his hands than any of the rest: "a man who goes by feet can
      never really go by accent . . . the pure accentual system is totally inadequate. . . . to rule
      accent altogether out of English prosody would be, to me, absurd. You must keep it in its
      place, and take care that that place is a minor or subsidiary one" (iii, 515, 496). However, a
      close inspection of Saintsbury's pronouncements on the accentual theory of meter suggests that
      he thought it counted stresses but not syllables; he seems to have had the misconception that
      stress-metrists believe all English verse to be merely accentual verse rather than
      accentual-syllabic verse. If so, that would indeed be a flagrant misprision, but not so
      flagrant as the one that Saintsbury commits in scanning the Old English and ballad meters as
      foot verse. He mistakes foot verse for stress verse and stress verse for the footed.
      Saintsbury rejects, then, both timing and stressing, though he misconceives, I think, both
      theories to some degree, while at the same time accepting some aspects of both theories. He
      was not one to be bound by the chains of consistency; But finally there can be, I believe, no
      middle ground. The two theories cannot be reconciled on the same plane. And on such a
      criterion, and even with all his evident ambivalences, Saintsbury must be said to scan mainly
      by stresses. In Saintsbury's defense, however, two things may be said. First his conception of
      Equivalence (Substitution) is a necessary and vital part of any coherent theory of meter
      (Saintsbury himself thought elision "hideous"). Trochaic substitutions in the fifth feet of
      iambic lines are unquestionably verboten. Second, the Foot Theory becomes vastly more
      attractive if we interpret Saintsbury's length or quantity to mean metrical ictus. The concept
      of ictus is a very respectable one these days, and not any the less so for its not being very
      well understood. It is in fact true that the ictus in English verse can be filled by any of a
      number of phonetic features--stressing, change of pitch, duration, timbre, any unusual feature
      of articulation. Since the phonetic basis of metrics still remains obscure in its fine
      details, we are in one sense no further along than Saintsbury was, and if we thought he knew
      what he was doing we might think him wise to refuse all pat and premature answers. It is for
      such reasons as those above that the first Book in the Historical Manual is essentially
      worthless, since it is there that Saintsbury presents his system. The second and third Books,
      however, presenting (respectively) the history of the poets' verse-technique and the metrists'
      theories, are admirably succinct. The fourth and last Book of "Auxilliary Apparatus" contains
      an unfortunately dogmatic Glossary and a too-brief bibliography, but it also contains two
      other resources nowhere else available--a list of major English poets, summarizing the
      prosodic achievements of each, and a list of major English verseforms, explaining the origin
      of each. Altogether, the design, scope, and convenience of the Historical Manual make it a
      useful work even yet, and after proper exhortations of caution, one can still recommend it to
      advanced undergraduates. </note>

     <note> The first essay is reprinted by the Augustan Reprint Society, Publication no. 55. Ed.
      Paul Fussell, Jr. Los Angeles: University of California, 1956. Say's position in the evolution
      of eighteenth-century metrical theory is a transitional one: he is very intent to preserve all
      the old trappings of Quantity in his metric, yet he admits the ligitimacy of the substitute
      Accent, and he denotes syllables by musical notes as well. He defines the foot as "so many
      sounds as may be united together in One Movement"; "they are distinguish'd by different Names,
      according to the different Quantity or Disposition of the TIME in which we pronounce 'em, or
      the Stress of the Voice that is laid upon 'em." The equivocal or persists throughout. The
      syllables "Of Harmony," for example, "if we regard the Time only, [are] two Pyrrhicus's, but
      the Former, [of these is] distinguish'd by a strong Accent, which gives it, to an English Ear,
      the Force of an Iambick." He allows six elementary feet (spondee and tribrach), excluding the
      pyrrhic; its "Defect of Time is, in some measure, supply'd by a Stronger or Weaker Accent."
      The Appendix to the Postscript is noteworthy for the antipathy to elision that it expresses--a
      commonplace for a century thereafter--and for a couplet, contrived to illustrate the equality
      of timing in the lines despite variances in count of syllables, which become something close
      to a touchstone in the later prosodic literature. Say shows some indebtedness to Pemberton
      (E611), but he is important historically for his stiff resistance to strict syllable-counting
      ("Smooth and Unvaried Uniformity of Numbers") and his early approval of metrical
      expressiveness. Fussell's rapturious estimation of Say (E34, pp. 111-17) is, however, an
      over-reading. Both the temporal and the accentual theories of English meter are embraced by
      Say. </note>

     <note> Sheridan opposes application of all foreign metrical systems to English: it has neither
      the strict syllabism of the French nor the quantities of the classical meters. He is emphatic
      about the accentual basis of English meter: the English poet "need not pay the least attemtion
      to quantity." He even believes that accent regulates quantity in English, as did so many
      grammarians, but with a twist: in Sheridan's view the accent may fall on either the vowel or
      the consonant of an English syllable: if on the former, then the vowel is lengthened, as is
      the syllable, but if on the latter, then the syllable is shortened. This idea he reiterates in
      all four of his treatises. Metrical feet he thinks "correspond to bars in music," though he
      does not press the analogy and in fact keeps its members distinct. He allows eight feet, four
      disyllabic and four trisyllabic, giving them such names as "third trisyllabic," etc.; the
      monosyllabic foot ("syllabic iambus") is also allowed. Wooden regularity in meter is deplored,
      and trochaic, pyrrhic, and spondaic substitutions are allowed for variety. Strict regularity
      of stress in verse is of course proper, as it is in music, but is superseded by the demands of
      Variety and Expression. It is Sheridan's unique theory of accent which allows him to hold that
      English verse has both that which the classical verse had, and more--i.e., that our verse has
      feet formed on both quantity and accent: "we are not only allowed the use of all the ancient
      poetic feet . . . but we have duplicates of each, agreeing in movement, though differing in
      measure, and which make different impressions on the ear, an opulence peculiar to our
      language, and which may be the source of a boundless variety." But this bivalent system
      eventually leads to disaster, as Sheridan is forced to revert to the classical terminology for
      the quantitative feet while employing his own for the accentual feet, simultaneously; the
      double system becomes a double bind. The whole thing is clearly unsupportable, though Sheridan
      ploughs ahead manfully. Sheridan may have developed his theory as early as 1762 (cf. his
      Lectures on Elocution and Dissertation of that date). </note>

      be a poet without versing, and a versifier without poetry"), but Sidney only faces the issue
      squarely near the end. Though he had tried his hand at quantitative verses in the Arcadia, the
      mood for experimentation soon dissolved in the face of the prosodic realities of making verse
      in English: "Now, of versifying there are two sorts, the one Ancient, the other Modern: The

      (taken from the 1888 Accent and Rhythm perhaps by J. Blake (E484)) is intriguing. He dismisses
      the concept of "foot" as a vestige of a foreign metric and argues instead that the metrical
      unit in English is a clustering of weak syllables around each stress. The groups he allows
      are: Tone (Ì ), Accent (Ë Ì ), Cadence (Ì Ë ), and Extension (Ë Ë ). (Reasons are given for
      excluding other possibilities.) These four types produce sixteen possible forms of five-stress
      (and also four-stress) lines. The principle for defining these metrical units is clearly
      morphemic-syntactic, and one is left to wonder what other priniciple might be preferable. What
      is lost here, one sees, is the counterpointing of metrical units against word- and
      phrase-boundaries. But then again some descriptive adequacy is gained. </note>

     <note> An important essay, despite its location: Taglicht quarrels with Wimsatt &amp; Beardsley

      recitation, but that "by no process of abstraction . . . does it seem possible to arrive at
      the traditional metrical foot." The relevance of a given phonological feature for meter is not
      a matter of either-or [this is the received opinion] but of degree, so that a "scale of
      delicacy" is possible in analysis: the patterning of a feature may or may not be included in
      metrical analysis depending on what degree of description is desired. The terms "meter" and
      "rhythm" are nearly useless by now; "architectonic rhythm" and "pictorial rhythm" would be
      better. Syllables in English bear stress (here, "rhythmical stress"), "accent" (intonational
      prominence), and "tone" (pitch)--making up four degrees of prominence altogether. A metrical
      analysis discriminating all four varieties turns out to be (based on the examples here)
      remarkably delicate. </note>

     <note> Rev: by Bjorklund in PTL 4 (1979): 192-95; by Standop in Anglia 97 (1979): 218-32. I
      believe it was C. S. Lewis, in his essay on "Metre," who first articulated the modern
      disparagement of inductive studies of meter. Tarlinskaja's massive study should put that ghost
      finally to rest. Surpassing the work of Omond, Bridges, Smith, Stewart, Chatman, Halle-Keyser,
      and Tsur in both scope and detail, EVTH is the most extensive and most important study of
      English verse- structure produced in this century. Like the earlier analyses of Mayor,
      Bridges, and Young, Tarlinskaja's analysis is inductive, but unlike theirs her 230 pages of
      discussion and conclusions are based on a computer-assisted inventory of over 100,000 lines of
      verse from the 13th to the 19th centuries, the results of the analysis being displayed in 103
      pages of statistical tables and charts. Hence, EVTH is truly the first work on English meter
      which we can legitimately acknowledge as both comprehensive in scope and based on a thorough
      examination of the evidence. It treats all three principal English metrical systems, the
      syllabo-tonic (accentual-syllabic), tonic (accentual), and free verse, specifically the
      dramatic and non-dramatic iambic pentameter, the iambic and trochaic tetrameter, four-stress
      meter (esp. ternary), and mixed forms--the mixed syllabo-tonic/tonic and the mixed
      syllabo-tonic/syllabic. In Tarlinskaja's theory, metrical position or ictus is distinguished
      from linguistic stress, the strong position (ictus) being filled by (a mandatory) one syllable
      and the weak position (non ictus) by (a permissible) one to two syllables. The concept of the
      metrical foot is affirmed and the five commonest meters are admitted: iambic, trochaic,
      anapestic, dactylic, and amphibrachic. Anacrusis is also noted. Meter is defined as "the
      alternation of ictuses and non- ictuses in a certain sequence, regardless of the phenomenon
      which serves as the basis of this alternation." In a given meter each of these two positions
      in the sequence, each of these two positions in the sequence will be one of two types: ictuses
      are either obligatorily stressed or predominantly stressed; nonictuses are either obligatorily
      unstressed or predominantly unstressed. For each meter investigated Tarlinkskaja develops a
      complex statistical profile of the accentual and syllabic variations, identifying the metrical
      norm, the deviations, (acceptable or anomalous) from that norm, and the metrical threshold at
      the far edge of deviation where the meter becomes some other meter or nonmeter. Chapters 1-3
      treat premetrical problems, viz., the accentual structure of Middle and Early Modern English;
      Tarlinskaja affirms the existence of "doublets" and investigates the surprisingly high
      percentage (80 %) of monosyllables in English verse. Chapter 4 treats Middle English rhymed
      verse, chapter 5, the iambic and trochaic tetrameter, which weakened in their syllabic
      structure in an early stage to become four-stress verse (Tarlinskaja adopts the term for the
      Russian form of this meter, the "dol'nik"), both binary and ternary. Chapters 6 and 7 treat
      the dramatic vs. the non- dramatic iambic pentameter, and the final chapter, the odd hybrid
      verseform of Donne's Satyres. Four Appendices treat some curious and intriguing problems in
      comparative versification. This is a seminal monograph, full of a wealth of information by no
      means yet fully mined. It should also demonstrate to anyone not yet apprised of the fact that
      it is not the English who are pioneering the study of verse in this century. The study is
      based on ten years of previous research: </note>

      the syllable is determined first of all by semantic and grammatical (chiefly syntactic)
      factors. A scansion system is proposed for phrasal stress with three degrees ("strong phrasal
      stress, secondary stress, and lack of stress"), each degree having also two subdegrees, with
      different symbols for occurences in ictic and nonictic positions in the line (making twelve in

     <note> Glossing Lehmann (L457), Tarlinskaja explains the shift from OE stress-verse to the

      ones reveals their accentual, syllabic, and metrical structure. These patterns turn out to be
      "diffused," i.e. not clear-cut, but in general the ME line contained eight syllables, three to
      four stresses (almost equally distributed), and four ictuses. (King Horn has six, two to
      three, and three.) A considerable number of other specific features are also analyzed
      statistically. Conclusion: though ME poetry shows mixed and transitional forms, it mainly
      displays "an accentual-syllabic character." </note>

     <note> The article is about evenly divided between analyses of Stress Verse and Syllable-Stress
      (accentual-syllabic) Verse. In the first half (drawn in part from E678), Tarlinskaja examines
      the Middle English rhymed verse of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, especially King
      Horn and four other poems. Tabular data is presented on Number of Syllables per line, Number
      of Stresses, Number of Ictus Positions, Lines with Iambic beginnings, and Disyllabic occupancy
      of nonictic positions (the loosening of the accentual-syllabic pattern). Lines missing a
      syllable at the caesura also seem characteristic of the period. The second half of the essay
      examines Modern English verse with respect to syllabic variation (mono- or di-syllabic in
      nonictic positions) in Donne, Pope, Shelley, and Byron. Donne is found to be the poet closest
      to the pure accentual pattern, with more syllabic variation than his successors. E683a -----.

     <note> A lengthy statistical analysis of samples from nearly all the major English poets
      reveals the location of the limen between Metrical and Unmetrical in the poetic line. At what
      point does iambic verse becomes non-metrical? If more than 5% of the lines have disyllables in
      a weak (nonictic) position; if more than 25% lack stresses in nonictic positions; if more than
      21% have stresses in nonictic positions. No more than 2% of the lines may have no more than 5
      "non-typical" syllables. Overall, English iambic verse contains about 2% unmetrical lines.
      Conclusions apply to "non-dramatic Modern English iambic pentameter." The method used here
      synthesizes concepts from both traditional and generative metrics in order to locate the
      "marginal thresholds." </note>

     <note> From the august, nearly rhapsodic tone of this piece I had almost thought it by Ransom;
      was it for him, at least? Thompson chides Stein for attributing to meter functions which are
      properly those of intonation, or performance; what meter is and does, utterly by itself, is
      not easy to see: the most one can say, Thompson concludes, is that "meter is nothing but an
      imitation of language. . . . Imitation itself is the sufficient reason of meter. For what
      poetry imitates . . . is the structure of the language itself. . . . Art comes to reality
      through artifice." Toward this end, T. shows that in Sidney's verse there are two attitudes
      toward meter: in the Arcadia, the linguistic stresses are matched precisely and supply to the
      metrical pattern; in Astrophel and Stella the correspondence is no less exacting, but "Sidney
      manages to combine a formal satisfaction of the metrical pattern with phrases whose stresses
      frequently violate that pattern." I. e., the meter so prevails over speech stresses which
      within their phrases so thwart it that nearly every syllable in the line is emphasized, giving
      a remarkable elevation to the whole throughout. Sidney's meter, then, is "supremely
      contrived," and it was his genius to see that two systems could interact while being kept
      separate. </note>

      traditionally have been welded together in English poetry. In response, Sutton insists that
      Enlgish meter is based on number of feet and not number of syllables in the line; he also
      argues that Milton did not resort to elision to regularize the syllable-count in his lines.

     <note> Saintsbury's (A8) judgment of Wadham was that "he really knows . . . nothing whatever
      about the subject" (vol. 3, pp. 440-42), but this is too severe. Wadham's book may not detain
      anyone's notice beyond one inspection because the weight of the book rests on an eccentric
      (hence irritating) new terminology for all the old familiar devices. For that, oblivion. Yet
      he can also lucidly separate the quantitative from the accentual prosodies, recognizing that
      the old, dogged effort of the grammarians to preserve the Latin system and force it onto
      English, by calling accented syllables long and unaccented short, caused irreparable harm and
      literally centuries of delay in the advance of clear thinking. That recognition is just,
      salutary, and valuable. E695 Watts, Isaac. "The Author's Preface" to his Horae Lyricae. Poems,
      Chiefly of the Lyric Kind. London, 1706, 1709, etc. Many editions. See esp. pp. ciii-civ,
      cix-cx. The Preface elaborates a pious defense of poetry against the charge of profanation,
      maintaining that verse may properly be used by the Christian pen to win souls away from baser
      attractions. Watts approves of sonnets, "the free and unconfined numbers of Pindar," Miltonic
      blank verse, heroic verse (couplets), and "the narrow metre of our Psalm translators" (ballad
      meter) as appropriate forms. He considers Milton too long in his periods, too "harsh and
      uneasy" in numbers, and too quaintly uncouth in diction. But couplets should have an equal
      "variety of cadence, comma, and period. . . . It degrades the excellency of the best
      versification when the lines run on by couplets, twenty together, just in the same place, and
      with the same pauses." </note>

      has quantity like the Greek, but for us "the quantities of syllables are but the variations of
      accent." English meter has feet (but not monosyllabic ones); the pentameter consists of "five
      feet, or ten syllables" and must end in an iamb, two trochees in a row being offensive. But
      Webb is strongly in favor of trisyllabic substitutions for expressive effect. (On this point

      Seboek (A19), pp. 193-96. Followed by two very important exchange; see below. A landmark white
      paper in the history of English metrics: Wimsatt and Beardsley's essay is undertaken as an
      explicit restatement and defense of the traditional account of metrics against two newer
      systems, the structural- linguistic and the temporal-musical. The authors criticize Chatman
      for an "insufficient [pragmatic] concern for the normative fact of the poem's meter" over and
      above the level of linguistic features, and they criticize Whitehall for failing to
      differentiate the level of isochronism (rhythm) from the level of isoaccentualism and
      isosyllabism (meter). The Trager-Smith analysis "may be helpful" but it also "may be in excess
      of any strictly metrical need." But more generally, the objection to linguistic metrics is
      that "the poem is not to be identified with any particular performance of it, or any set of
      such performances. . . . not everything which is true of some particular performance will be
      necessarily true of the poem. . . . A performance is an event, but the poem itself, if there
      is any poem, must be some kind of enduring object." Temporal metrics may be classed together
      with linguistic--since timing is a linguistic phenomenon--as equally (mistakenly)
      performance-oriented. And the problem with musical scansion is that it specifies time-values
      too precisely; it is directive rather than descriptive. Verse can indeed be isochronic, but do
      we know that it is invariably so? Meter, however, inheres at "certain rudimentary levels of
      linguistic organization" where the only important feature is "relative degrees of stress . . .
      in certain positions." In the authors' view the two principles of English meter are not time
      and stress but rather stress-counting and syllable-counting; these produce the two chief
      metrical systems in English, stress verse and syllable- stress verse, relatives whose affinity
      is obvious but ancestry obscure. Northrop Frye was mistaken to identify the pentameter line as
      an overlay or higher level of the four-stress line. But it is the Relative Stress
      Principle--whereby the slack of one foot may be stronger than the stress of another, judgments
      being allowable only within the foot--that is the linchpin of English syllable-stress meter.
      (Wimsatt and Beardsley also accept the Allophonic Principle--the second of two equal impulses
      will be heard as louder--and its implication, the impossibility of pyrrhics and spondees.)
      Other metrical orderings are possible, such as the hierarchical multiples of "dipodic feet."
      The structural linguists, however, are right to focus on the matter of tension (the authors
      prefer to substitute the term "interplay" for the same idea), as in the promotion and
      supression of medial stresses so as to conform to the meter. The meter is one of the two poles
      generating that tension, and not the tension, or a result of the tension. How do we know? "You
      can write a grammar of the meter. And if you cannot, there is no meter. But you cannot write a
      grammar of the meter's interaction with the sense, any more than you can write a grammar of
      the arrangement of metaphors. . . . the free and individual and unpredictable parts of the
      poetry. You can perceive them, and study them, and talk about them, but not write rules for
      them. The meter, like the grammar and the vocabulary, is subject to rules." A retrospective,
      after two decades, may find some of the fine points of this essay decidedly blurry, and it may
      be surprised to notice a curious repetitiveness of structure, but these are mere quibbles
      against the solid mass of this seminal essay. Naturally, the essay provoked sharp responses
      soon after: see the ensuing exchanges between Wimsatt and Beardsley and Joseph Hendren (E357)
      then Elias Schwartz (E328). See also B. Q. Morgan (E603). (Written for or just after he

      variation," either by displacement of metrical points or a change in syllable-count, or
      "countermetrical variation," either by weak stresses under ictus or strong stresses outside of
      ictus or else by the choice of junctures--an explanation of "the impression of speed" in verse
      (if it is not a "lexically-induced illusion" it is caused by addition of extra syllables or
      else weak stresses under ictus), a very succinct survey of the types of elision, and a
      distinction between poetic style, interpretation, and performative style. On sound-patterning
      he deprecates mimesis, offers an anatomy of devices, and observes that "the rhyme actually may
      provide information by limiting the possibilities of interpretation." Close analyses of the
      poets are interpolated. N. B.: "I have never been able to discover a good reason for assuming
      that a metrical accent point has any closer connection with the zero that it follows than with

      most significant treatise in the field of metrics since Bridges (E491); Chatman provides a
      full-scale theory of an order which has been rarely matched. His procedure is empirical
      throughout, and the study never strays very far from its data. "Meter itself is a system,
      parallel to and actualized by, but not to be confused with, the linguistic system." Chapter 2
      surveys the psychology of rhythm, since meter is, by general consensus, a species of rhythm. A
      very long Ch. 3 reviews elementary phonology, since the relevant event or unit-object in meter
      is the syllable, followed by the nature of prominence or ictus in meter; length, stress, and
      pitch are closely examined, "stress" is defined, and the importance of pitch in stress is
      emphasized (following Bolinger). Chapter 4 reviews earlier Objective studies of meter as well
      as Russian Formalist/American Structural-Linguistic work. Chapter 5, the crux, states the
      theory: inductively, we do scan poems--meter is agreed to exist--but no one linguistic feature
      can be shown to be an invariable signal of metrical ictus. "Lexical stress unambiguously marks
      metrical ictus . . . unless overridden by [phrasal stress]"; in confusing or ambiguious
      contexts, the "metrical set" of expectations will then act to denominate the ictus and pre-
      serve meter. Scansion is a notation of the meter of a recitation, while metrical analysis is a
      composite summing of all the scansions; "the meter in this sense is a consensus, not a
      normative formulation." The foot is defended on grounds of theoretical elegance and the
      pyschological reality of grouping. Four degrees of syllable-stress are denoted (a, b, c, d)
      producing thirty-two varieties of disyl- labic feet, excluding spondees, pyrrhics, ambiguous
      feet, and mono- and trisyllabic sybstitutions [hence, no "metrical pause"], which are also
      allowed. Chapter 6 provides a sample analysis of Shakepeare's Sonnet 18; eleven professional
      recordings are analyzed on a sound spectrograph then checked against the judgments of a panel
      of expert judges; conclusions, pp. 182-83. A final chapter speculates on the functions of
      meter--an important and much- neglected subject. See also Wode (E703). </note>

     <note> The monograph which constitutes the formal application of the methods of structural
      linguistics (the Trager-Smith phonology; see D32) to English metrics. Dispensing with the
      traditional binary metrical system (stressed- unstressed), the structural analysis notates all
      the intonational features present in the normal production of speech, in four degrees of each:
      stress: primary secondary teriary weak /, /\, \, Ë; pitch: highest high mid lowest 4, 3, 2, 1;
      juncture: end-of-word end of phrase end-of-clause end-of-sentence +, |, ||, #. Assuming also,
      then, the Relative Stress Principle (stress differences on syllables are relevant only within,
      not across, the boundaries of the metrical foot) and what later came to be called the
      Allophonic Principle (the second of two objectively equal syllables will be heard as
      louder--subsequently a much- disputed rule), the iambic foot may be redefined as
      "weaker-stronger," and if the metrical pause is allowed as well, the Epstein-Hawkes analysis
      yields 186 types of possible iambic feet (taking into consideration only stress and juncture;
      adding pause yields another 44, and the inclusion of pitch as well [the authors consider pitch
      peripheral, however] produces a total of "only" !) 6,236 types of iambic feet in English). The
      method is applied to Samson Agonistes. Varieties of trochees: 96 (stress and juncture only),
      besides 86 more (pause), or a total of 2,460 (including pitch). Possibilities for the anapest
      run several thousand higher, with those for the dactyl being somewhat less, though in both
      cases the stress differences between the three syllables of the foot are characteristically
      quite pronounced. And though the authors define the metrical line typograph- ically, as a line
      of print, they reiterate that the basic patterning (unit) in meter must be binary for sheer
      simplicity of description. Probably the strongest feature of the whole structural-metric
      analysis is its efficacious demolition of larger metrical units in favor of the traditional
      binary and ternary units, even of binary alone (the ternary may be subsumed under the binary
      isochronically). The authors conclude that English verse is fundamentally iambic. On the
      strophic leve they recognize that the context controls the scansion of specific problematic
      lines, under a principle of greatest prevailing metrical consistency. The strophe does in some
      sense define and determine the line (meter), so it is at this level that an index of metrical
      tension becomes practicable for a text (see p. 49), an index which would score gradations in
      its features both above and below the norm ("matrix"). "This is the difference between fine
      and coarse analysis," true enough, but structural metrics also clearly proceeds from an
      assumption not that meter is made out of language but that meter is language. In practice the
      authors ignore the conventionality of meter, in its reduction of the linguistic system. This
      represents, in Jakobson's terms noted by Fowler, a confusion of verse design and verse
      instance. No reader perceives six thousand types of iambs. Meter, both to be written and to be
      read, must be a very simple pattern, underneath its elaborations. </note>

     <note> This lambent essay adapts the recent insights and concepts of structural metrics to
      explain how meter interacts with grammar at both its higher and its lower levels, syntax and
      phonology. The "counterpoint" of meter against syntax is essentially that of the line against
      the sentence, and Fowler shows through examples that it would be possible to construct a
      "scale of enjambement," an index sensitive to the force of the meter, essentially
      discontinuous, pulling against the force of the syntax, toward continuity. (Note that
      counterpoint must be sustained to deserve its name.) The play of metrical paradigm against the
      phonological structure of the language (stress), however, is properly termed "syncopation" not
      "counterpoint." The metrical pattern must be kept visible in order for tension to be created;
      otherwise the rhythm is "sprung" out of its proper sphere of concessions and aggressions into
      a simple stress verse. </note>

      (juncture and strong stress), and Measure (pitch pattern and stress). Thus she has a
      tripartite criterion for evaluating the metricality of a line: unmetrical, uncadenced,
      unmeasured. A line that fails all three is "irregular." Finally, she tests the efficacy of her

      measure is rising or falling and comprises units of one stress and up to four slacks; cadence
      comprises eleven poetic and five prose feet (in Eliot). The analysis of the poem correlates

      are inaccurate]--in order to show "the inventive ease with which [Herbert] adjusts colloquial
      and metrical phrasing to each other," isolating also an important principle of "advancing

     <note> The seminar topic was the examination of metrics "in light of phonemic theory," since
      "there is no phase in literature where there is a more intimate relation between the structure
      of the language and the structure of the literary work than in metrics." The components of
      meter are three: stress (using Trager-Smith's four levels in the language and two levels in
      meter), juncture (three levels--rising, falling, level--vulgarly known as "caesura"), and
      isochronism. Two primary metrical traditions in English are identified: the isochronous (the
      native form) and the isosyllabic (the foreign, syllable-counting form borrowed in Middle
      English); there are also two main theoretical traditions: the traditional metrists (with
      concepts derived from classical verse), whose system is adequate only for isosyllabic verse,
      and the musical metrists (Lanier, etc.), whose system only describes isochronous verse. Both

     <note> Both the original and revised theories of generative metrics are unsatisfactory, the

      trochees are unquestionably admissible after juncture at the beginning of the line, so why not
      elsewhere? Subsequent trochees after juncture are simply generalizations of the line-initial
      case. Beaver replies politely (and correctly) that the authors do not define "juncture"
      adequately. He does not mention the fact that they do not pursue their thesis to its logical
      end, where "Never, never, never, never, never" would then be an acceptable iambic pentameter.

     <note> A summary review of the development of the school; Beaver elaborates the direct analogy
      between transformational-generative grammar and generative metrics, argues that the new theory
      is "more rigorous" than any of its predecessors, rebukes structural linguists ("the concept of
      stress is not a phonetic one but a phonological one, and the theory is therefore in no direct
      sense dependent on performance"), reviews the Magnuson-Ryder "Distinctive Feature"
      alternative, and cites historical precedents for the generative approach. </note>

     <note> A later reassessment of the evolution of the theory and its problems; Beaver generally
      defends his "extended original theory" against the original 1966 theory (E775) and the

      verse are topics also treated; the section on nursery rhymes is particularly suggestive.

      the "greater rhythmic regularity" in verse of short lines may be explained generatively: short
      lines are 50% denser in stress maxima. Triple meters seem to rely heavily on set syntactic
      formulae, such as prepositional phrases, which put stress on the third syllable. The
      traditional "foot," enjambement, initial inversion, and metric stylistics are then considered
      in turn. Beaver suggests revised stress rules but insists that Halle-Keyser's metrical
      principles offer a "unified explanation" of the iambic pentameter line. The generative system,
      however, is augmented by Chatman's analysis of five types of syllables (E713). </note>

     <note> Argues that Halle and Keyser's conception of the "standard theory of metrics" (against
      which they are reacting) is erroneous: the perfect pentameter line is not the "norm" from
      which all variations (initial trochees, etc.) are deviations; rather, the consensus in
      traditional metrics has been that variations are a part of the norm. Nor is the perfect
      pentameter line any "ideal," since poets have so obviously labored to vary it. Thereafter,
      protracted attributions from Bridges, Saintsbury, Omond, and McAuley follow. Finally, Bowley
      offers his own set of four metrical rules, which will "account for all possible metrical
      patterns": these differ from the generative account in that "metrical variation is . . .
      accounted for by differences in the underlying metrical patterns, not by differences in the
      way the correspondence rules apply." A tumid article but a trenchant criticism. </note>

     <note> A lucid critique of generative work to 1976. Cable criticizes the Halle-Keyser theory
      for "two crucial flaws": (1) taking the stress maximum rather than the foot as the metrical
      unit, and (2) assuming that only stress ("segmental units") matter for meter, rather than
      other "linguistic givens" (i.e. "suprasegmentals" such as pause, duration, pitch, juncture).
      The "only progress [in Halle-Keyser] was the articulation of an explicit goal [Rules for
      determining Metricality] for the study of meter." Moreover, Cable argues persuasively that the
      generativists have been scornful of if not oblivious to much of the earlier scholarship of
      real value in metrics. He considers Beaver's work to yield some progress, in that it tries
      explicitly to work out other and better rules for metrical generation. Magnuson and Ryder's
      theory is dismissed because it lacks generalization altogether: any rule written applies only
      to that line and no other. Altogether, he concludes, the sole advance of the generative
      approach is the effort to make the metrical rules explicit. </note>

      almost any random string as a metrical line). The objections to the generative metrics are
      "unanswerable." The latter hald of the article argues for the existence of the "metrical
      pause." In sum it is an elegantly written piece by a sometime Timer; cf. his position in the

      decided limitations. Most conspicuously, the linguistic model exaggerates the extent of
      poetry-as-a- piece-of-language: "although their basic material is linguistic and therefore
      subject to description in linguistic terms, metrical and literary conventions are
      non-linguistic aspects of form." Less conspicuously, the key concepts of T-G grammar, such as
      abstract pattern, tranformational rules, deep structures, competence, or grammaticality, have
      shown only very limited uses in metrics. Fowler distinguishes between the methods of
      theoretical metrics and metrical stylistics and then enumerates advantages and disadvantages.

      because her enigmatic dashes "often serve to prevent unmetricality," but two rules need to be

      from unmetrical lines. To this end they define the abstract (deep) metrical pattern of the
      iambic pentameter line as having ten metrical positions, five even, five odd. Second, they
      define the conditions under which a postion may be occupied by more than one (surface)
      syllable. Third, they define the stress maximum (a syllable with stress greater than that on
      both syllables adjacent to it), which may (or may not) occupy an even position but may not
      occupy an odd one, as the fundamental criterion of metricality. The stress rules to be applied
      are lexical, and a provision is made for caesurae (stress maxima undergo "neutralization"
      across "a major syntactic boundary"). Two Condition rules allow disyllabic occupancy of the
      metrical positions. </note>

      statement of the revised Halle-Keyser theory of generative metrics. It contains an
      introductory section on general principles, a section on Old English alliterative verse, and a
      section on the iambic pentameter. The revised rules are as follows: For Old English verse
      ABSTRACT METRICAL PATTERN: (i) A verse line is composed of a first and second half-line (ii)
      The first-half-line is composed of (X)*X (iii) The second half-line is composed of X(W)*
      CORRESPONDENCE RULES: (i) Each X corresponds to a single S, or One X in a half-line may
      correspond to an S and a W in either order DEFINITION: If in two or more stressed syllables
      the zero or more consonants that pre-cede the vowel are identical or begin with an identical
      consonant or s-cluster, the syllables alliterate. (ii) Syllables in S positions alliterate;
      syllables in W positions do not alliterate For modern English verse ABSTRACT METRICAL PATTERN:
      (W)*SWSWSWSWS(X) (X) where elements enclosed in parentheses may be omitted and where each X
      position may be occupied only by an unstressed syllable CORRESPONDENCE RULES: A position (S,
      W, or X) corresponds to a single syllable or to a sonorant sequence incorporating at most two
      vowels (immedi-ately adjoining or separated by a sonorant conso-nant) DEFINITION: When a fully
      stressed syllable occurs between two unstressed syllables in the same syntactic constituent
      within a line of verse, this syllable is called a "stress maximum" (ii) Fully stressed
      syllables occur in S positions only and in all S positions, or Fully stressed syllables occur
      in S positions only but not in all S positions, or Stress maxima occur in S positions only but
      not in all S positions, Since the Correspondence Rules are ordered from least to greatest
      generality, lines which violate them will be progressively less metrical in the same order.
      Lines violating rule (1) will normally be considered acceptable variations, while lines
      violating rule (iii) are simply unmetrical. Counting each infraction of each rule as one unit
      will give a numerical score of the metrical complexity (i.e. degree of metricality) of the
      line. (This procedure is unchanged from the original version of the theory.) </note>

     <note> Published after the codification of their theory in English Stress (which appeared in
      Feb. 1971), Halle and Keyser here reprint a succinct account of the modified theory and
      respond directly to the criticisms of Wimsatt (E814) and Magnuson-Ryder (E821). They reject
      Wimsatt's view that the meter "exerts a certain kind of coercion . . . a quiet 'promotion' of
      certain weaker syllables"--i.e., that the meter can "tilt" the "linguistic givens." The Halle-
      Keyser view is that "meter is an abstract pattern embodied in linguistic material by virtue of
      specific correspondence rules"; Wimsatt's approach is "contentless." They defend the concept
      of the "stress maximum." The Magnuson-Ryder theory is examined at length and dismissed, its
      rules having no applicable generalization beyond the separate lines they describe. </note>

      contrasts at length the generative theories to the earlier "taxonomical" (descriptive) ones
      and rejects the notion of a "metrical competence" in speakers analogous to the linguistic
      competence. "The main fault of standard theory is . . . that it tries to grasp all possible
      and allowable deviations by means of a list" (rather than a rule). But the generative theory,
      on the other hand, "is not able to distinguish between metrical and unmetrical lines," is
      flagrantly accomodating, and "cannot establish a difference between iambic and trochaic
      lines." The older empirical theory is to be preferred to the newer theory, which is
      "fundamentally inadequate" because its formulation is "a statement on the nature of the

     <note> Based on her dissertation, DAI 34 (1974): 4210A (U.S. C.). Computer analysis (using the
      Dilligan programs) of samples of the verse of the Post-Chaucerians disproves the thesis that
      these poets misunderstood the master's versification; rather, they extended metrical variation
      beyond the limits Chaucer allowed himself as well as adding new possibilities. Specifically,
      they more frequently (1) filled one metrical position with two syllables, expanding the range
      of permissible elisions, (2) elided unstressed suffixes to their roots, (3) dropped a syllable
      in position 5, leaving a rest after the caesura (Lydgate's "broken-backed" line), and (4)
      rhymed stressed syllables with unstressed. Metrical complexity scores: Chaucer, 1.8; Dunbar,
      2.0; Hoccleve, 2.7; and Lydgate and Skelton, 3.0. Chaucer's grace and "lightness" of line
      result from stresses often falling under ictus; his followers, in contrast, often weighted
      their lines by spreading stresses into non-ictic positions. But more interesting still is the
      discovery that stress-neutralization by adjacent syntactic break is radically different from
      neutralization by adjacent stress, producing a much smoother effect stylistically. </note>

      characterization of styles, and (3) close study of a text, Meyers distinguishes three schools
      of metrists: Traditional (e.g. Fussell, Wimsatt &amp; Beardsley, Fowler), Performance
      (Charman, Epstein and Hawkes), and Language-Competence (Halle-Keyser). Traditional metrics is
      "in essence a psychological theory" and "workable but unnecessarily complicated." The extreme
      variation in oral performances of poetry has not yet been adequately comprehended in a
      notation system, and so Performance metrics is not yet successful. Linguistic metrics,
      however, is "the most promising of modern theories of meter," because it assumes that "the
      language . . . together with the shared competence of speakers of the language, provides
      sufficient information for describing the metrical situation." In short Meyer prefers the
      Halle-Keyser apparatus. He does however admit its difficulties and suggests as partial
      solutions a revised notation system and a reduction from Halle-Keyser's de facto three levels
      of stress to two by dismissing the notion of neutralization. </note>

     <bibl>"Trochaic and Iambic." Language and Style 8 (1975): 127-56. </bibl>
     <note> The author collects a number of apparently trochaic lines with initial iambic
      substitutions in order to show that they can be proven metrical by the Stress Maximum
      Principle though not by traditional scansion. [Note however that the examples are nearly all
      in tetrameter verse, that the percentages for occurrence in pentameter and tetrameter verse
      vary widely and consistently, and that Newton admits several of the sample poems are in mixed
      meters. Traditional metrics would say these lines are regular headless iambics.] Initial
      inversion is four times more prevalent in iambic verse than trochaic, and medial inversions
      have similar frequencies. Newton criticizes Hascall's approach (E783) and concludes that
      Structural Metrics by nature will never be able to give a coherent differentiation of
      "trochaic" and "iambic" lines. Halle and Keyser never will either until their generative rules
      are revised. Newton's own approach (summarized on pp. 146-52), based on the experiments of
      Snell, Woodrow, Warner Brown, and the like, specifies differences in rhythmical grouping:
      trochaic feet are shorter than iambic; the length of stress to slack is 2:1 in iambic but 1:1
      in trochaic. An essay very wide in scope, but discomfitingly disorganized. Cf. Hascall (E783),

     <note> Agrees with Ihwe that generative-metrical rules have only taxonomic value and that what
      they predict is either tautological or nonexistent. The only new and valuable concept is that
      of the "filter." "Complexity" is attractive, too, though the counting-method of complexity
      ranking eliminates any possibility for an explanation of the nature of complexity. A study of
      the position of more complex lines in a poem would give us more information than the present
      "leveling" method. Kiparsky's system has gaps and cannot indicate hierarchies of accentu-
      ation. His alternation rule will not serve even if refined because it pays insufficient
      attention to secondary stresses in W-positions. The "constrastive" and "emphatic" stresses of
      Bierwisch also will not do. Schultz argues that the cyclical application of the stress rules
      in classical generative phonology will suffice. Application to the verse of Stefan George.

      of "stress maximum," "position," and "complexity." The generative theory is "a fatal step
      backwards" in metrics. More generally, Halle-Keyser are guilty of both ignoring Rhythm (i.e.
      hebungen and pauses) altogether and also of an "assumption that the poet is guided principally
      by the verbal material." Deviations in the number of syllables . . . are felt to be

     <note> Despite the date of publication, most of this theory was worked out from 1969-72; it
      represents an attempt to embed the basic Halle-Keyser framework within a much wider, more
      highly formalized psychological (Gestalt) theory of meter which integrates (1) some of the
      current understanding of human processing of perceptual patterns and (2) the concept of
      Performance at a fundamental level in the theory, in order to achieve greater refinements of
      explanatory power, i.e. greater "delicacy" of description, by converting Halle and Keyser's
      dichotomous metrical determinations (metrical, unmetrical) to a continuum of finer
      discriminations of metrical complexity. The five fundamental categories of Tsur's theory along
      with their components are: DIMENSION: conventional--i.e. formal, as in meter linguistc--the
      phonological rules of stress and syntax performative--the set of conditions in which the
      elements of the conventional and linguistic dimensions tend to group into, and establish
      themselves as, perceptual units. Here the metrical set, syntactic set, and other perceptual
      character- istics of the auditor, the performer's style, and the prosodic givens pertain.
      CORRESPONDENCE: (essentially the three Halle-Keyser Correspondence Rules) Linguistic stresses
      in relation to metrical positions may be: confirming, non-confirming, or infirming, the result
      of which may be compensation, violation, or neutralization of the meter. Grouping may be
      either backward or forward. UNIT: Beat is the unit of stress, meter, and performance.
      STRUCTURE: Systematic hierarchical ordering of units. The "foot" serves as the unit of both
      stress and meter; above it is the line. Normal stress-placement in meter creates a
      stress-maximum; stress-displacement to the left creates a stress-valley, to the right a
      stress-grade. STYLE: At the highest level, convergent or divergent. A large number of specific
      types of metrical variations may be graded on both quantitative and qualitative scales in
      order to define, describe, and weigh features of style. Chapters treat Metricality, Caesura,
      Iambic/Trochaic and Ternary meters, Rhythmical Performance, Perception of Poetic Rhythm
      [perhaps the core of the book], Perceptual Forces on meter, syntax, and sense, Converg-
      ent/Divergent Patterns, and the Stanza. A long Epilogue appraises the problem of critical
      estimation of metrical style. The general structure of the entire argument is set forth in a
      twenty-page prefatory Synopsis. Much more is treated in the text, of course, and in fact the
      theory goes far beyond the Halle- Keyser framework (Tsur manages to put considerable distance
      between himself and them in chapter 1). Section 8 on Performance is especially stimulating.

      observing that the iambic pentameter has traditionally been defined precisely by its five
      stress-units. Several invented examples serve as "a challenge to the notion that a sweeping
      negative rule (plus a merely optional rule about major positive features) will render certain
      minor positive features irrelevant to a definition of a meter." The Halle-Keyser rules give
      description of metrical complications in the iambic pentameter line but not explanations how
      or why these particular complications should exist (and not others). Wimsatt adopts the
      (Structural) position that the meter alters or adjusts the mid-range stresses in speech. But
      "rules of language do not include rules of meter. The meter . . . is something that the poet
      adds to the linguistic givens, without contravening them." Finally, Wimsatt urges the
      recognition of a difference between the rule (the outer limits of legitimacy) and the norm
      (the varying, average, inner realization). </note>

     <note> This very substantial treatise examines the similarities and differences in English and
      German verse by applying the Magnuson-Ryder (E819-21) framework, as well as American
      Structural and Russian Formalist theories. The author observes the facts that English verse
      differs from German in that it has dropped unstressed syllables, resulting in the occurrence
      of contiguous (stressed) lexical stems in the verse, while German on the other hand,
      preserving its wider inflectional system, has preserved unstressed syllables between lexical
      stems, which "thus allows for a closer approximation to the metrical scheme." Thus English
      verse has a higher degree of apparent irregularity or "freedom." And in contrast to these two
      languages, Russian has "such a highly developed inflectional system and consequently such a
      high degree of poly-syllabicity that it does not allow for the occurrence of stress on
      alternate syllables." The general assumption throughout the work is that the possibilities of
      metrical form "appear to be connected more with the distributional properties of the language
      itself than with constraints specifically of prosody." Perhaps this will turn out to be one of
      the axioms of comparative metrics. Too, the whole area of the relation of meter and
      morphology, explored here by Bjorklund, has been ignored traditionally and deserves further,
      more systematic investigation. </note>

      (sorting metrical from unmetrical lines) on the grounds that since all lines imperfectly
      fulfill the abstract pattern, a heirarchy or gradient of metricality is what is needed.
      Finally they reiterate that the theory accepts too much. The Magnuson-Ryder theory proposes a
      metrical grid of ten slots, five Even, five Odd; features marked are Word-Onset, Weak, Strong
      and Pre-Strong. Of these latter, there are sixteen possible combinations. Then a set of Base

     <note> A criticism of Kiparsky's first theory (E827) on both general and specific grounds.
      Generally, (1) his system finally reduces itself to his "monosyllable constraint," whereby
      "the metricality of a line of poetry depends solely on whether or not the odd positions--if
      they are stressed--are filled with monosyllabic words"; (2) a metrical theory based on the
      line as unit and on the counting of its syllables cannot very well distinguish iambic from
      trochaic. Specifically, (1) Kiparsky's rules are too narrow to be borne out in the corpus of
      English verse; (2) they are also too accomodating in other respects, admitting unmetrical
      lines; (3) they are "not explanatory of English metrical practices but rather give only a
      superficial description of the syntax"; and (4) his "prosodic rule," by grading out all
      stresses but primary, ignores metrically relevant secondary stresses. Note too the important
      recognition made on p. 219. </note>

     <note> At once both a formidable and extended critique of Kiparsky (E827) and also an
      affirmation and modification of Magnuson-Ryder. Chisholm cites "serious flaws" in Kiparsky's
      theory, such as unacceptably weak constraints (e.g., an imprecise classification in the
      Monosyllable Constraint) and the use of four levels of metrical stresses instead of the
      customary two. But worst is Kiparsky's double-headed "failure to distinguish the three
      separate domains of music, meter, and language. On the one hand he equates musical rhythm with
      poetic meter; on the other he confuses meter with language . . . [since] his notation for the
      underlying metrical pattern consists of integers which designate stress- levels in the
      language. . . . Above all, the Kiparsky theory fails to specify precisely . . . all the
      categories with which it operates." In Chisholm's view the inadequacy of both Halle-Keyser and
      Kiparsky is their failure to postulate "an intermediate level of abstraction," the Prosodic,
      between the (surface) Linguistic and the (deep) Metrical. He then sets forth his modifications
      of Maguson-Ryder based on the work in L319-21. </note>

     <note> In a major strategic revision of his 1975 theory Kiparsky adapts the very recent work on
      phonological stress by Liberman (see Liberman and Prince, D83), the central feature of which
      is that stressing is derived and expressed via tree notation (as in transformational syntax)
      instead of by numbers. This procedure is adopted because it permits major simplifications in
      the design of the theory, but more importantly because "superficially identical stress
      patterns are differentiated in the Liberman notation in a way that point by point corresponds
      to distinctions in versification." The basic pattern for the iambic pentameter in its most
      neutral realization is established as STRESS METER /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ W S W S W S W S W S Of hand,
      of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ W S W S W S W S W S The metrical complexity of
      the line, or the degree of its metricality, is then a function of the matching of these two
      trees. Mismatches may be either permissible or impermissible. Kiparsky's sole criterion for
      impermissible matching- -i.e. the one situation that will render a line unmetrical--is a
      lexical stress (S) over a metrical slack (W). That is, lexical stresses must always fall on
      metrical ictuses. Such vertical mismatches are termed labeling types; bracketing types
      (horizontal mismatches, as it were), e.g. STRESS METER /\ /\ /\ W S W S W S W or summer,
      winter, autumn /\ /\ /\ W S W S W S W [i.e. trochaic words in an iambic line], are also
      important determinants of metrical complexity. Inversion or foot-reversal Kiparsky explains
      handily by showing that "such a labeling mismatch never occurs together with a bracketing
      mismatch." Other aspects of the theory work out secondary stresses, syllabification and
      traditional elision, level stress, metrical idiolects, the iambic/trochaic dispute,
      extrametrical and missing syllables, the ordering of Metrical Rules, and stipulation of three

     <note> The first formal statement of the third theory of generative metrics to be proposed so
      far. Kiparsky criticises Halle and Keyser for failing to exclude non- verse and failing to
      distinguish a sufficient number of degrees of stress. His view of Magnuson and Ryder is that
      "their metrical rules are adhoc and do not lead to any explanations," revealing "a failure to
      draw the right distinctions between phonology and metrics." His own theory, claiming not only
      descriptive but also explanatory and predictive adequacy, defines meter as "a system of
      correspondences between musical and linguistic rhythm" (Kiparsky speaks also of "the musical
      rhythm that underlies verse," but this seems adventitious), admits four degrees of metrical
      stress (denoted by the numbers 1- 4, strongest to weakest) which correspond to the four
      degrees of stress in the language (though Kiparsky's actual examples betray this statement and
      reveal that his metrical levels are effectually binary), and takes account of word and phrase
      boundaries as well as patterning of stresses, on the argument that meter organizes not only
      phonological but also morphological and grammatical features as well. The system includes six
      components: Acual Phonological Representation The line itself. ^ | Prosodic Rules) Specify how
      the patterns are to ^ be mapped onto linguistic strings | (by defining what counts as a |
      "syllable," etc.), i.e. how | metrical positions may match | syllables. | Derived Metrical

      genres. only on monosyllables or ^ after intonation breaks. | ^ | | | Abstract Metrical

     <note> A recently discovered rare incunabulum antedating the two Atomic Wars has been subjected
      to Total Metrical Analysis; compared with the Anglo-Saxon Fragments preserved in the
      sub-Himalayan vaults, this poem shows much less skill in alliteration, both in faulty
      verse-types and in a wooden, repetitive style. Altogether the poet's use of alliteration seems
      self-conscious and forced, as if he were out of touch with the tradition or trying to imitate
      a moribund tradition rather than merely being incompetent. Too, his verse frequently falls
      into a "trim-pom-trim-pom" rhythm, varied by "pom-petty-pom," which seems to be evidence
      supporting the hypothesis recently advanced that there also existed a rhymed, syllabic
      verse-tradition in Old British poetry (none of which has survived, of course). Whether such a
      syllabic tradition was only beginning at this time, or whether it already existed and was
      influencing this poet's attempt at revival of an earlier form, we do not know. </note>

      chapter 3, "Mighty Metres and Jingling Bells: A Poet's Prosody," a long examination of
      metrical theory (the author is extraordinarily well-informed on metrics since 1950), "meter
      and speech rhythm" (she goes so far in distin- guishing the two as to offer separate scansions
      for a given line), rhyme, and "graphic representations of sound and meaning." Accepting
      "intensity" (stress) as the basis of meter, the author adapts the notation system of La Drière
      (E570). ED's metric is found to derive from hymnody, her most frequent choice being Common
      Meter. This is probably the most rigorous technical treatment of ED's poetry in print. </note>

     <note> All four poets employ accentual meter "almost exclusively for subjects of major

      engagement." Hopkins of course created an entire prosody out of overstressing. Hardy uses
      stress meters relatively little on the whole, yet they appear repeatedly in his most intensely
      expressive passages. Pound uses them both as archaisms and to convey a sense of tragedy,
      loneliness, and tersely emotional speech. Auden uses the Old English meter as a more
      formalized convention, its associated heroic themes thereby forming an ironic contrast to
      modern life. </note>

     <note> See Whalley (E262). Discovery of Coleridge's review of Samuel Horsley's 1796 work on
      Greek and Latin metrics (M104) provokes a full review of Coleridge's readings in and
      theorizing on metrics, given the prosodic ambience of the day. A surprising--very
      surprising--conclusion emerges: Patterson argues that Coleridge's metrical theory (he must
      have read Foster and Gally (M66-74) besides Horsley, in addition to his own classical training
      at school) was "quan- titative," though it recognized that accent in English "lengthens out"
      the time of the stressed syllable, so that the Christabel line is to measured by temporal
      regularity, each equal to all the rest in total time, and generally containing four stresses
      with isochronous intervals between them. In effect, then, Christabel was for Coleridge not
      stress-verse but timed verse (count of stress being of secondary importance), and his metrical
      theory was Temporal. The "foot" is to be discarded and the line taken as the metrical unit.

      stress meter of English folk verse has remained un- changed for well over a milennium.
      Moreover, the three or four commonest ballad meters also happen to be the musical meters of
      many hymns and popular (secular) songs as well, and so command an extraordinary latitude. Such
      unexpected modal solidarity implies that our oldest and finest lyrics are, at least in one
      sense, indeed "all, all of a piece throughout." The best recent account of ballad meter is
      that given by Malof (E581), though George R. Stewart Jr. is still the authority on the
      subject; see his two books and numerous articles. Note too that many of the articles in
      Appendix C on the setting of verse to music are con- cerned with ballads; see especially
      Boswell's work. </note>

     <note> A full counterweight to Bronson (N16); Coffin argues vigorously that the bal- lad
      originated in Anglo-Saxon alliterative verse and in "recited narrative obitu- ary verse" not
      in singing; the influence of music (and the device of end- rhyme) was only felt by the ballad
      later. This fact, that the ur-ballads were "more dependent upon linguistic than musical
      principles for their metrical form" can be further borne out by noticing that ballads are
      still set as stress verse, so that "not counting the unstressed syllables offers an area for
      extempo- rization in singing or reciting." An analogous situation appears in modern jazz. The
      ballad is, in short, verse before it is song. </note>

      (esp. Wyatt and Sidney) as foils to Herbert's own craft and purpose (Chapters 3 and 4). Since
      the chief feature of all the Psalters was the uniform wretchedness of their verse, and since
      Herbert's own craft was subtle and complex, Freer's conclusion about Herbert's motices

     <note> Freer shows how Sidney expanded the range of his expressiveness immensely, in his
      psalms, by learning to control enjambement, feminine rhyme, and syn- tax, while varying his
      metrical and stanza forms, until he had become a poet who "[thought] through and by means of
      his forms. </note>

      52 (1939): 324-25. Hendren is still the standard and most comprehensive sourse available on
      the subject. His general method is to examine "the rhythm of ballad poetry by studying it
      primarily as a element of folk-song"; in other words, he conceives of metrical language as
      simply one of the elements in [and not, alternatively, a correlate to] the larger rhythmical
      framework of the music. Consequently he applies the musical notation system to verse as well,
      following the earlier Mu- sical metrists Thompson (E404) and Croll (E344). Like Lanier (E364),
      but un- like Omond (E310), Hendren thinks that the temporal basis of verse is triple time, not
      duple. The bulk of the study is organized by the ballad meters (Common Meter, Long Meter) and
      stanza-patterns. See Hendren's later monograph at E356. </note>

      which Kupke says there are generally three; originally there were five, but compression of the
      final three into one produced the "end- weighting" or climactic form that is so characteristic
      of the ballad. The con- clusion must be prepared for, hence thematically there is a steady
      heightening throughout the three scenes, while rhythmically there is usually a falling-off or
      dimunition in the second part as a brief respite before the end, though of course both
      dimensions are proceeding simultaneously. The tripartite structure was termed by Axel Olrik an
      "Epic Law." </note>

      being Long Meter in the four-stress a b c b quatrain. The dipodic foot need not always have

      An inquiry into the development of the most popular and prolific form of verse in English
      during the last two centuries, the stress verse of ballads. Stew- art devotes chapters to four
      varieties of metrical variation--(1) trisyllabic sub- stitutions, (2) monosyllabic feet, (3)
      metrical pause, and (4) dipodic verse. His metrical theory is Temporal, defining the foot as
      an approximately regular time-interval. His subject is delimited because "for the period under
      discussion metrical freedom began earlier and developed further in this form of verse than in
      any other. . . . The general course of metrical development in the past two centuries has been
      toward greater metrical variation. An accompaniment of this process has been the return of the
      native popular measures to literary us- age." Two preliminary chapters describe the standard
      form of ballad meter and its development before 1700. But two features of this study
      especially stand out: one is the chapter on Dipodic Verse; the other is one's realization here
      that the Temporal theory of meter is particularly suited to describing the structure of stress
      verse. See Stewart's later monograph at E333. </note>

     <note> In chapter 2 (section 4) and in chapter 9, Wither defends the propriety of translating
      the Holy Word into verse, and more specifically into a "variety of Numbers," on the grounds
      that the original Hebrew is indeed verse, even though not of the sort found in Greek and Latin
      poetry, and not in such pen- tameters or hexameters as are familiar to us (though if the lines
      seem syllabi- cally unequal, he reasons, doubtless the original proununciation would not have
      made them so), and on the grounds that the Hebrew does indeed Rhyme, as the Church Fathers
      have told us. And since "the Hebrews are full of variety in their Numbers, and take great
      liberty in their Verses," and since the subjects of the Psalms themselves are also various, it
      is therefore fitting that they be translated into "many kinds of Verse." In short, Wither
      believes that the Hebrew original has isosyllabism and rhyme, these two being sufficent cri-
      teria to make it "verse." </note>

      developed by Gerard Manley Hopkins in the 1870's has not yet been fully assayed by metrists,
      though we have begun to sift what Hopkins thought he was doing and said he was doing from what
      he actually did, which is the essential preliminary. Sprung Rhythm means stress meter no
      syllable-counting meter, and ultimately the theory pivots on precisely that phenomenon which
      will unhinge or un- spring the normal accentual-syllabic (i.e. alternating-stress) meter in
      English, contiguous strong stresses. The interested student must be willing to tackle the
      whole subject entire, for Hopkins' own statements are not in themselves entirely reliable. But
      he critical commentary here is not yet so voluminous as to be intimidating, as it is elsewhere
      in metrics. </note>

     <note> If, a century ago, a brilliant young student [Hopkins], his brain afire with an
      intoxicating new approach to poetry, had written out his theses and taken them to the
      Professor of Poetry [Saintsbury, Baum, anyone with the requisite ossification of metaphysics]
      for a review, he would have received in answer a version of this essay: "As exposition [young
      man,] this is disappointing. . . . I shall try to translate some of [your] picturesque
      language . . . into the conven- tional terms in ordinary writings on prosody . . . it still
      seems best to deal pa- tiently with [you], if only because [you are] an impetuous novice in
      prosody, too impatient to think [your] theories through before [you begin] to explain them."
      In any event, such is precisely what Hopkins receives here. Baum con- siders Sprung Rhythm
      "not a form of verse, to be scanned by feet, but a form of Prose Rhythm not amenable to
      scansion and therefore not to be explained as verse." </note>

     <note> Hopkins' theoretical studies in Greek metric were undertaken after his own creative work
      had been accomplished, in the main, and they bear little relation to his actual practice,
      which is Anglo-Saxon in nature and not at all like Greek. In fact, Hopkins' understanding of
      Greek metric was by and large sim- ply mistaken, as was that of most of the authorities of the
      day whom Hopkins read. (He was also led astray by his penchants for music and mathe-matics.)
      But here we may observe the remarkable aesthetic phenomenon of a false the- ory yielding
      excellent results in practice--even an entirely new form--by a fer- tile misapprehension.

      on pp. 12-20) is the perfect embodiment of that aesthetic because it provides, at once,
      naturalness (the rhythms of speech), regularity (in stressing), and variation. </note>

     <note> A test of Donoghue's belief that poetry is most successful when meter and all other
      elements co-operate in creating sense, against the counter-theory (Ran- som, Hopkins at times)
      that meter provides merely an "independent phonetic pleasure," by undertaking to show that
      "when in Hopkins the internal [rhyme, alliteration, or lexical compounding] pattern is heavier
      than the sense pattern, there is grave risk of an uncreative distortion of the language." In
      short, Donoghue reacts to an unqualified admiration of Hopkins' technique by trying to show
      that at times it falls short of or overreaches its mark, the perfect fusion of sound and
      sense. </note>

      (E925). H. argues that criticism of Hopkins' theory of Sprung Rhythm--considered purely as a
      theory--has always been unfavorable because critics: (1) rely on his "Author's Preface" to his
      Poems, which is unsatisfactory in many ways, being more an explanation of his own practice
      than a general theory, (2) have judged his theory by his practice (H. explicates the theory
      from the surviving letters and documents), and (3) give undue attention to features relatively
      minor in the context of the whole theory, such as scansion. Beyond this she does not
      go--giving an effect similar to a translation of a Rus- sian text into French for an English
      reader: we are one step closer, but not en- tirely home. See esp. chapters 3 and 4. </note>

     <note> Rev: by Standop in Archiv 211 (1974): 134-41. Ludwig's book amounts to an extended
      exposition of Hopkins' theory of Sprung Rhythm. It is not, and was never intended to be, a
      neutral analysis or a critical commentary: Ludwig accepts Hopkins' system, which he wishes to
      dis- play with the utmost clarity, without pursuing any higher clarity which might modify or
      contravene the theory. This strategy is excoriated repeatedly by the implacable Standop in his
      bearish review (that is, he criticises Ludwig for not doing something he never intended to
      do), a review which very soon turns into a direct frontal attack on the theory of Sprung
      Rhythm itself. Ludwig accepts the distinctions betwen meter, rhythm, and perform- ance, and
      hence the conception of interplay or tension between the abstract metrical pattern and its
      linguistic filling. Chapter-subject: 1, general concepts of metrical theory and of Sprung

      151-59. Too long by half, Father Ong's close scrutiny of the chronology of Hopkins' readings
      establishes that he could not have derived his theory of Sprung Rhythm from Milton, Old
      English, or anywhere else; all these studies come after the crucial notes of 1873-74 and the
      writing of the Deutschland in 1875. Hopkins only gradually realized the full extent of the new
      rhythm he was hearing, but he was "hearing it everywhere," which shows it was in the grain of
      the language itself, not contrived. What is remarkable is that Hopkins was the only major poet
      of his age in touch with the primary rhythms of the lan- guage. Ong's detailed study of
      Running, Counterpoint, and Sprung Rhythms reveals their "affinities" with Old English, with
      the rhythm (alternating stresses) of the language, and with the mainstream of English poetry
      continuously from Chaucer to the end of the nineteenth century. Hopkins did not invent "sense-
      stress rhythm"; he discovered it. Points of interest here: Ong rejects Whitehall's dipodic
      theory of Sprung Rhythm; he considers Hopkins' practice of beginning every metrical unit with
      a stress "a mere convenience" even for Hopkins himself and so he discards it and argues that
      scanning should proceed across the line-end break; he notes the frequency of parallel
      half-lines and judges that Hopkins' rhymes are "only fuller developments continuous with
      effects built everywhere into the verse." </note>

      section one ("Prosody and Milton," pp. 112- 22) in Chapter V. The friendship and
      correspondence between Hopkins and Bridges had very significant effects on the metrical
      theories of both men: Bridges tried parodic and authentic sprung rhythm, Hopkins was intensely
      in- terested in Milton, and both explored a mutual interest in the structure of music. </note>

     <note> The new metric called Sprung Rhythm first presented in The Wreck of the Deutschland was
      less revolutionary an accomplishment than one might other- wise expect; when placed in the
      context of the increasing metrical experi- mentation of the nineteenth century--the more
      frequent use of the anapest, leading to logaoedic duple-triple meters--and especially when
      viewed against the background of a number of very similar effects developed slightly before
      Hopkins by Swinburne, The Wreck will be seen as not an "altogether novel invention" metrically
      but actually "a blend of conventional and sprung rhythm, with the former predominating," i.e.
      "an anapestic poem in a sprung frame." Indeed, the preponderance of the poem scans remarkably
      well as conventional mixed duple-triple meter. Hopkins' new rhythm was achieved with
      startlingly little modification of the traditional metric of English. As a distinct new meter
      the advantages of Sprung Rhythm were greater "naturalness and flexibility"; its disadvantages
      were a "frequent lack of both rhythmical and rhetorical clarity" (since no regular subliminal
      metrical pattern exists to help us assign stresses and disambiguate meaning in problematic
      phrases, we have to try to make out the meaning itself before we can discern the scansion; the
      meter itself is not a guide to meaning), the loss of the subtler shadings of articulation, and
      the loss of the complex counterpoint between language and meter. </note>

     <note> Despite Hopkins' explicit statements that his metrical theory was based squarely on

      of Sprung Rhythm demarcate isochronous measures of time which are dipodic, in the sense

      sprung-rhythm verse that "follows Patmore's theories almost to the letter." W. adopts the
      sigla of G. R. Stewart (E333) for scansions--Hopkins' favored patterns are SpLp, SpLO, SOLp,

      which regulates only number of syllables is a modern phenomenon, an emblem of our de- sire to
      Make It New, though the more general principle of syllabism has always been an important
      aspect of English versification, especially in early Middle English and in the early
      eighteenth century. Bridges' Testament of Beauty seems to be the longest syllabic poem in the
      language, though (undeservedly) now nearly forgotten. </note>

     <note> A subtly complex argument sketched out too briefly: in all but her very latest work,
      Marianne Moore employs sporadic rhymes, fracturing of words across line-end, and other
      prosodic devices to altogether minimize the effect of her syllabic verse and thus render it as
      similar as possible to free verse, which is the form she originally began working in--a form
      where there is a distinct sense of the line as rhythmic unit. The "mathematical" tone which
      critics have noted in her poems is derived not from the versification but from other elements.

      the form: a fixed number of syllables, a roughly fixed duration of time or breath for each

     <note> An urbane consideration of the devices which render Marianne Moore's syl- labic verse so
      effective: avoiding the complexities of stanza and rhyme, she cre- ates "poetry without

      prose-poem but poetry with prose's rhetoric, complexity and ease." Inclusion of quotations,
      apt phrases and allusions, and avoidance of regular stress and lines with even numbers of
      syllables (both tending always toward the iambic) also secure the novelty and vigor. Milton's
      late work and the brilliant footnote to Housman's 1933 Stephens Lecture are also discussed.
      Syllabic verse, Fuller concludes, is "an extension of more tradi- tional meters, not a denial

      Yeats never lost his faith in meter or rhyme, and his increasing use of "highly irregular

     <note> A condensed version of his dissertation. The change in Elizabethan dramatic taste in the
      1590's toward imitations of classical satire produced plays which, following the misconception
      of the time, were "rough" or crude in taste, themes, and versification. Concerning the lat-
      ter, "rough" seems to have meant irregular cadences, juxtaposed stresses, and perhaps rapid
      tempo. Burke analyzes the 1598 play The Scourge of Villanie using the scansion-method of La
      Drière (four degrees of stress); the analysis confirms Marston's own statement that he wrote
      Satires "rougher" than other genres. Burke's primary interest, though, is in the relation of
      the meter to the rhythmic phrasing-groups, those phrases and clauses set off in the syntax by
      pauses or commas. Extensive statistical tables delineate the nature and degree of these
      congruences/divergences, and indeed, I know no better study than this available on the complex
      relation of syntactic phrasing and meter. </note>

     <note> Remarks on Blake's inventiveness in meter and rhyme--i.e. blank verse (espe- cially
      tetrameters), mixed meters, and "metrical prose" for the early lyrics, the iambic and
      anapestic septenary (with alexandrines and occasional classical hex- ameters), for the
      Prophetic Books. The later Long Line Damon takes to be in stress verse, and he notes that
      Blake seemed little concerned whether his work was "prose" or "verse." Relies on Saintsbury
      (A8). </note>

     <note> A critique of Swallow's analysis of the "broken-backed" line in Skelton and Wyatt
      (K389). Evans shows that the inflectional ending -eth (also -es) was regularly employed not
      only in Middle English but also in Middle Scots up to the fifteenth century as an optional
      metrical device for regularizing syllable- count. It is so used by Wyatt as well, and he also
      uses it for metrical elision--to regularize stress-placement (the inflectional -e is an
      entirely different problem, but only a minor one in Wyatt). Hence many of Wyatt's pentameters
      are more regular than has been thought. His early work is scarcely less regular than his
      mature work, and statistically, both are quite comparable in irregularity to that o Milton and
      Wordsworth. Some of his lines were experimental, and some others were meant to be tetrameters.
      Wyatt seems rough to us because he used metrical devices in ways unfamiliar to us, but they
      are the same devices used by all the major English poets. </note>

      functions of meter in poetry is expressive, the other is purely conventional: a poet's choice
      of meter is an implicit commitment to certain metrical styles, types, modalities, and genres,
      these establishing conti- nuity and comprising traditions, as Hollander shows in giving
      capsule histories of the iambic tradition, blank verse, the sonnet, lyric stanzas, and the
      anapestic elegaic meter, traditions which may be revised or broken at certain crucial points,
      "metrical crises," where the metrical contract between poet and reader (as defined by
      Wordsworth) is redrawn--think of Chaucer, Wyatt, Davenant, Milton, Blake, Whitman, Hopkins,
      and pound, for example. Perhaps the para- digmatic case of all is Blake, whose
      subversive-restorative metric must be the ultimate source for the twentieth century's
      obsessive-dismissive interest in meter: Blake accepted certain metrical conventions of his day
      and rejected others, reshaping everything that fell under his touch in that pragmatic ap-
      proach to meter so characteristic of the Romantics. </note>

     <bibl>"Blake's Epic Meter." Studies in Romanticism 17 (1978): 163-92.</bibl>
     <note> Actually, "Blake's Epic Rhythm": Kumbier employs musical notation for "rhythmic
      scansion." Blake's verse shows rudiments of a formulaic style, both lexically and metrically,
      and K. sets semantically correlate passages from the various Prophetic Books alongside each
      other to show three types of repeti- tion--verbatim, adaptive, and complex--and the nature of
      Blakean meter, which is "a meter of interruption, a highly controlled interruption, though,
      whereby the contesting metrical voices are brought into the sharpest possible contrast, often
      with remarkable economy." Can such be a meter? It is not the foot or the line that is the
      metrical unit, K. argues, but this metrically formu- laic phrase; indeed, the distinctive
      feature of the scansions here is that they change time signatures within the line very
      frequently, K. claiming a change of meter within a change of rhythm. (This seems extreme.)
      Finally, he argues that Blake's statement in the Preface to Jerusalem that "the terrific
      numbers are re- served for the terrific parts--the mild &amp; gentle for the mild &amp; gentle
      parts, and the prosaic for the inferior parts: is fully justified so long as no one-to-one
      correspondence of metric mode to meaning is expected. the modes are com- plexly
      interpermeated. In any event, the pre-eminent mode of the Prophetic Books, the "mild &amp;
      gentle," is a manifestation of the limited vision of Beulah, hence unreliable. K's suggestion
      that caesura determines meter is a novelty. </note>

      criticism in the first. The third chapter (half the book) presents Melton's thesis: the
      stylistic idiosyncrasy which he finds to mark Donne's versification indelibly is the
      repetition of the same word usually in the same line but with opposite stress (first stressed,
      then unstressed, or vice versa): this feature he calls "arsis- thesis variation." Dense
      complexes of such words occurring close together turn out to be very frequent in Donne.

     <note> A piece of plain axiological cogency: "The greater degree of formal regularity in
      Surrey's verse . . . does not make him either a better poet . . . or a worse one . . . but
      first of all a different kind of poet." Wyatt is not a fumbler, and Surrey is not monotonous;
      it is simply that they have antipodal features of character, and hence, treatments of the
      verbal medium. Wyatt exalts individual experience in all its rough-ness; he advances himself;
      he loves conflict, tension; he bends and breaks forms to serve his will. Surrey, in contrast,
      values smoothness, "sweetness"; he prefers the submission of self in the embracing bonds of
      convention, the controlling artifice of pattern; he approves of order, resolution, law. In
      short, Wyatt and Surrey are the paradigms for two types of poet: "smooth lyric poets . . .
      whose music tends to control and contain their meaning, and rough lyric poets . . . who make
      form obey matter." </note>

      earliest non-derivative work, the Poems, Chiefly Lyrical) to 1842 (when his poetic art had
      unquestionably matured), which shows that his development was not erratic but simply richly
      diverse, and coherent: Tennyson worked in three major metrical modes simultaneously--the
      irregular ode forms (mainly four-stress lines; very ornate), stanzaic forms (the early ones
      spectacular, the later simpler but more durable), and sustained forms (essentially the mature,
      musical, but grave and elevated blank verse). </note>

      context of both conservative and rebellious eighteenth-century verse- systems (couplet and
      blank) as a prelude to examining the metrics and sonics of his major poems. See especially
      chapters 5 and 6. Methodologically, however, the work staggers and totters: Ostriker firmly
      distinguishes meter (pattern) from rhythm (realization) yet then pro- ceeds to use "basically
      Saintsbury's foot-scansion," marking stresses but assum- ing that "the structural basis of
      verse is the sense of regular recurrence in time." Most of the time only two degrees of stress
      are marked. This is a ground- breaking survey; we await now a concrete foundation. </note>

     <note> Examination of metrical variations and idiosyncratic forms of syntax reveals a fairly
      clear division between the prophecies of 1788-94, wherein Blake was interested primarily in
      the possibilities of the fourteener, and those of 1794-95, where his interest turned to
      developing a "double syntax" correspondent to his wider double vision. The syntactic features
      most of interest are the use of a word to modify the words both preceding and succeeding it,
      and the equating of two words to a third, whereby they become equilibrated to each other.

     <note> Based on his dissertation at the University of Birmingham in 1961. In chapter 10 on
      "Harmony of Numbers" Southall makes caustic remarks on the work of Foxwell (E990) and
      Padelford (E1034), jeering at their lists of ac- ceptable deviations and, indeed, any attempt
      of "classical prosody" to see Wyatt's lines as iambic pentameters. The following chapter
      explicates the author's own view of "The Construction of Wyatt's Verse": Wyatt's line "tends
      to fall into phrasal units separated by pauses, the values of which depend upon the general
      significance of the communication, so that the fundamental char- acter of the rhythm is due to
      the requirements of intonation, a feature that re- ceives no recognition from classical
      prosody." In short, it is a recognizable remnant of the older hemistichic line. Southall
      believes that manuscript punc- tuation (esp. the virgule) was used to denote rhythmical
      phrasing. </note>

     <note> It is only by meaning that we will come safely to meter in Donne, and not the other way
      around. His "wrenched accents" are rhetorical and intentional; they reach for a higher plane

      in MLN 36 (1921): 63-64; in TLS, 26 February 1920, p. 136. This book draws on three earlier
      articles published in TLS, 23 May-13 June 1918, pp. 242, 265, 277, 290; discussed in
      subsequent correspondence by Simpson, Wilson, and O'Neill, pp. 301, 313, 325, with a summary
      reply to all three by Bayfield on 1 August, pp. 361-62. See also Wilson (E411, N136).
      Bayfield's theory has two principal features: he believes that metrical eli- sions were not
      intended by Shakespeare but were the result of house styling for the First Folio; they
      therefore should be "resolved" (i.e., expanded), re- sulting in many trisyllabic feet. (This
      theory is as queer as it sounds, but in fact Saintsbury too thought elisions "hideous.")
      Second, he believes that English verse is actually trochaic rather than iambic--it is only
      that poets regularly add an extra upbeat syllable and drop the requisite final syllable, for
      some reason or other. This view, which is nothing but eccentricity in the finest English
      tradi- tion, is also propounded in E336 and in E1094 "Our Traditional Prosody and an
      Alternative." MLR 13 (1918): 157-82. </note>

     <note> The one sharp focus of proper perspective, we remember, is a resultant of fused twin
      perspectives: Beum offers here both (1) a lengthy and careful survey of the history of
      theories about Milton's verse-structure--from Henry John Todd and Dr. Johnson to James Whaler
      and F. T. Prince--emphasizing re- peatedly that it is the line as a whole, not the foot
      ("Milton is not a foot proso- dist") which is the metrical unit for Milton, a view for which
      he need not have gone to the Italians to learn; and also (2) a very full characterization of
      Milton's verse itself, in terms of rhymelessness (it offered sublimity, austerity, natural-
      ness, plasticity, dramatic propriety), alliteration and assonance, enjambment (the lines
      nevertheless end on heavy syllables), hypermetrical lines, elision, mellifluousness,
      strictness, and sonority. Beum concludes that "we need not radically revise the traditional
      description of Milton's epic verse" but reasserts his central point: the Miltonic line is
      essentially decasyllabic but not iambic. </note>

      and hypermetrical line-ends; repetitions of phrasing and entire lines; and others. These
      features are then traced through Marlowe's later plays up to Edward II; his metrical style
      develops toward vari- ety, even as the lines steadily lose their ornate rhetoric and diction.

     <note> Clemen argues that though rhythm is one of the most powerful elements in drama, its
      effects are unconscious and its dramatic functions scarcely under- stood. Thus, ordinary
      naming, counting, and scanning of meter is useless. Be- sides stress, pitch, tempo,
      tone-color, volume, and ease of articulation are im- portant, as well as diction, register,
      rhetoric, and dramatic delivery. Lichten- hahn, an actor, adds that technical knowledge of
      Shakespeare's versification is crucial for the actor's interpretation, though beyond that
      point the sheer power in the lines can be harnessed only by rhythmic stylization. He cites
      three ex- amples in Lear where verse-technique creates character. </note>

      sively primary." This sustentation of an elevated voice is the exact opposite of the effect in
      PR, where the leveling of accents works as gradation ("the syllabic pattern keeps the accents
      from being pronounced, and the accents keep the syllabic pattern from being incantatory"),
      while in SA the equipoised accents create a "rhythmic indeterminacy" wherein every line has

     <note> The description of later Miltonic blank verse given by Bridges in Milton's Pros- ody
      (E491) is here confirmed for Milton's early poetry as well: it is "regularly iambic and
      decasyllabic," and Milton definitely "scanned his verse in one way and read it in another."
      Thus, throughout all his pentameter verse, whether blank or rhymed, Milton scrupulously
      insures by the strategy of elision that his lines shall contain ten and only ten syllables.
      (The tetrameter verse however is frequently heptasyllabic.) There is a regular inverse
      correlation between date of composition and strictness of verse design in Milton; the latest
      verses are the freest, the earliest the tightest. Rhyming and stanza in Lycidas are also exam-
      ined by Diekhoff. </note>

     <note> Milton punctuated for three purposes--rhetorical/elocutionary, grammatical, and
      rhythmical--and when, in the superimposition of verse pattern on syntac- tic pattern, he had
      to make a choice, pointing (or absence thereof) for the sake of versification was generally
      given preference. </note>

     <bibl>Histriophone. London: The Hogarth Press, 1925. 40 pp.</bibl>
     <note> The interlocutors in Professor Dobrée's essay on dramatic poesie survey the whole
      tradition of blank verse, interpreting its development "histriophoni- cally"--as a dramatic
      instrument, that is--rather more than "prosodically"--in terms of rules and permissible
      substitutions--though the essence of that inter- pretation is a theory of three principal
      stresses to the line and "breath-groups." More engaging still is the larger argument that
      blank verse (the dramatic effect of which is speed and fluidity) and dramatic prose (the
      effect of which is rhythmic deceleration and delay) were evolving, in the later Shakespeare,
      and could still evolve into a higher form of "stage-prose," more stylized than common speech,
      yet more supple than the blank-verse line, than even the dramatic medium of The Tempest, which
      was "too subtle . . . too fine for the stage." </note>

      latter will show greater metrical variety. The author invites further analysis of the data

     <note> In constrast to those identifying Early, Middle, and Late styles, Eliot insists on the
      irrefrangible unity of Shakespeare's development, most importantly in its elevation of the
      natural colloquial language into a more refined arena. A sur- vey of Shakespeare's
      contemporaries reveals how crude their versification was in comparison; Shakespeare surpassed
      them in writing genuine dialogue and in putting great art even in the mouths of mean
      characters. But Shakespeare only became a great poet by finding solutions to his dramatic
      problems, and it is this "inner necessity" in the nature of drama which led to the development
      of his verse, early (King John) to late (Pericles). The late plays achieve a profundity and
      musicality of language within dream-worlds where play and ritual are fused. </note>

      have fitted as one. These must have been di- vided in manuscript, Flatter argues, and so the

      metri- cal irregularities, and the scheme so established is repeated to give a cumulative

     <note> A search of the recorded statements of Milton's contemporaries and the Eliza- bethan
      prosodists about "number" and "quantity" in verse; Koehler concludes (though without any clear
      consensus as support) that "apt Numbers" refers to the use of the metrical foot (not merely
      the count of syllables), and "fit quan- tity" to syllabic length, implying thereby Milton's
      awareness of the available resources of syllabic "weight" in the line, yet without implying
      that he in- tended to write in a quantitative metric. Since the final syllable in his lines is
      frequently "weighted," and since rhymes do occur in PL, Koehler judges that Milton objected
      not so much to the concept of rime as to the narrower, more tediously monotonous couplet rime.

     <note> A stinging rebuke to Bayfield, Saintsbury, Omond, and all those others who upheld the
      dubious doctrine of "trisyllabic substitution": "those who have written most extensively on
      Shakespeare's versification have been linguistically least qualified to express their views on
      the subtle problems involved." Their error was not to see that elision has been normal in both
      common speech and written prose as well as poetry since Middle English. K. cites extensive
      exam- ples of "doublets" (alternative forms of a word used to normalize the meter). Cf. Sipe
      (E1304). </note>

     <note> Blank verse poetry prefers Jakobson's "metaphoric" pole in language: its style is
      characterized "by repetition at varying intervals, by succession, and by conti- nuity." So, in
      Milton, repetition provides cohesion over clauses, and enjam- bement "carries the reader
      strongly forward" into the next line. The result is "forward contiguous movement." Marshall
      examines all of the eighteenth- century writers of blank verse, showing in a striking manner
      how each fash- ioned a prosodic instrument in his verse for his themes and mood. Word- sworth
      "re-assimilates" the Miltonic style. </note>

      reprinted. Vol. 3, pp. 206-32.</bibl>
     <note> Adopting Latham's x a system of scansion (E573), Masson briefly reviews the
      versification of Milton's poems in their chronological order then takes up se- riatim Milton's
      metrical craft and rhyme craft. The meter is of course iambic and decasyllabic, 5 x a, but
      variations are "equivalent," Masson says, to the ideal form, and he will allow "a Trochee, a
      Spondee, or a Pyrrhic, for the Iambus, in almost any place of the line." Trisyllabic
      substitutions in the meter are allowed too, in preference to any elision in pronunciation.
      Alexandrines, feminine endings, and caesura placement are also examined. On rhymes, the most
      novel conclusion is that Milton freely used imperfect (off, near) rhymes and dialectal forms.
      As perhaps the best statement of the traditional view of Milton's prosody (on the old
      principles of equivalence and substitution), Masson's essay still bears examinination. </note>

     <note> Many modern editions. Milton's decision to employ blank verse for his Epic seems based
      in part on the example of "both Italian and Spanish Poets of prime note" (for discussion of
      possible candidates, see E1121), and in part on his own repugnance to Rhyme, it being "no
      necessary Adjunct or Ornament of Poem or good Verse." The "true musical delight" consists only
      in "apt Numbers, fit Quantity of Syllables, and the sense variously drawn out from one Verse
      into another," not in any "jingling sound of like endings." The tone of this brief Preface is

     <note> An argument that the rhythm of the "Epitaph" should be distinguished from that of the

      them iambic nevertheless) yet weighty and somber in effect, not light or tripping. The
      critical uncertainty about the meter of the "Epitaph's" tetrameters is natural since "Milton

     <note> Keats shows a clear pattern of technical growth inot a "mature severity and sparseness

      common in Keats. Trisyllabic feet, entirely absent in Young, occur in the early Keats but not

      Alexandrines and triplets occur only in Lamia. Conclusion: Young seems intent on restraining

      in prosody to the sonnets of Della Casa and the verse and dramas of Tasso, besides Spenser.
      For the versification of his great epic Milton learned to forge a weighty but seamless meld of
      diction, syntax, and meter from the sixteenth-century versi sciolti, especially in Tasso. But
      Prince disagrees sharply with Bridges (E491) over the mechanism of the prosody, denying that
      Milton thought of his verses in feet at all. The whole concept of the metrical foot was a
      product of the late Renaissance Humanist revival of learning; Dante and Tasso, earlier, speak
      only of length of line and rhyme as the elements of verse. The rhyme-patterns of the choruses
      of Samson Agonistes take their origin, Prince concludes, in the dramas of Tasso, Guarini, and
      Andreini, the rhythms, in elaborations and ex- tensions of analogues to the Italian
      hendecasyllable, in Spenser's November ec- logue, and in the self-confidence and virtuosity
      Milton had gained in writing Paradise Lost. Altogether the prosody of PL is based on rhyme
      even though it dispenses with rhyme, in that Milton preserves in the final word in the line a
      gravity, a full measure, a weightiness which remains even though the sounds no longer jingle.

     <note> A thorough metrical analysis of the 2155 lines of the Sonnets produces useful

      Shakespeare comes down to, finally] and (2) rhyme and sound-patterning, these conclusions
      being weakened only by some arguable scansions and a no- tation system deserving one more
      sweep of Occam's Razor. Findings: trochees (5% of the 10,761 feet here) occur in all five feet
      in the pentameter line (under constraints set by five Metrical Rules which Ramsey stipulates),
      even split across the caesura; there are 56 "pyrrhic-spondee combinations" and 21 un- metrical
      feet in the Sonnets; 7-12% of the lines have feminine endings; both discrepancies in terminal
      consonants of rhyming syllables and also identical rhymes were quite acceptable to the age;
      many off-rhymes occur; and the sheer amount of internal rhymes and general sound patterning is

     <note> Had Robert Bridges written on Shakespeare instead of Milton (E491), he would have
      produced something like this study of pronunciation, meter, and elision in the pentameter
      line. The problem is extra syllables and three posi- tions have been taken: (1) they count
      both for pronunciation and in the meter; (2) they should be pronounced but not counted
      metrically; and (3) they do not exist and deserve neither. Making some telling points against
      the prevalent second ("semielision") position, Ramsey concludes, from textual evidence,
      remarks by Puttenham and others, and doublets, that Shakespeare intended "a strict
      disyllabism" in his metrical feet. </note>

      between two dramatic characters, in preference to "broken verse" or "shared verse." He gives a
      critical review of the methods of earlier workers using this characteristic to date the plays:
      Conrad's original study simply counted occurrences; Pulling analyzed the types of breaking
      without specific attention to this type; König was interested only in where the end of the
      first speech fell in the line; Hereford misunderstood König; and Chambers treated only the
      pentameter. Reinhold's method is to set the total number of broken verses over the number of
      dovetailings (change-in-speaker), giving a percent- age. Application to all the major
      Renaissance dramatists. </note>

     <note> Not a strict metrical analysis but rather a broader approach to rhythmic play in the

      and "rushing" rhythms. He also treats of the relation of meter to syntax (or colon to line)
      and of the variations of meter against the iambic pentameter norm for rhythmic effect:
      hovering stresses, overweighting, and endstopping retard the tempo of the verse, while
      slurring, extra slacks, enjambements, feminine endings, and short cola accelerate its tempo.

     <note> Rev: in Shakespeare Studies 6 (1972): 385-87; in Yearbook of English Studies 1 (1971):
      241-43. A study somewhat narrow in scope but very, very rigorous in method, leading to one
      narrow but irrefragable conclusion and several others, by implication, much more important.
      Sipe, in an effort to discriminate purely lexical from metrically influenced lexical choices
      in Shakespeare's lines, searches the 74,817 lines of the canon for "syllabic variants" (i.e.
      doublets, words etymologically related or synonymous, varying only in number of syllables,
      e.g. against vs. 'gainst). Such variants appear in 12,814 lines, of these only 63 % (.5%) show
      a usage in spite of the meter. Conclusion: "Shakespeare was in fact greatly con- cerned about
      preserving the regularity of his verse. . . . [and] chose particular word-forms with metrics
      in mind." Even neologism seem to have been formed partly so as to fit the meter. This study
      should be the complete anti- dote to those turn-of-the-century aberrations about Shakespearean
      trochaic meter, trisyllabic substitutions, and unreliable orthography. See also Kökeritz

      Blank Verse of Milton." Symonds has been sometimes dismissed if not damned by later prosodists
      for adopting the "intuitive" approach, since prosodists, fanatical about precision of
      statement and detail, abhor anything that smacks of impressionism; Omond's virulent
      characterization of Symonds' methods as amounting, "practically, to a negation of prosody," is
      both spiteful and undeserved. In fact Symonds' slim little volumne has been continuously
      quoted and approved, due mainly I think to the surprisingly fresh yet acute discussion of
      Accent and Quantity in the first chapter. His critics were foolish to believe that
      "non-technical" means "not ac- curate" or even "not useful." The historical survey of B. V.

     <note> Attacking critics such as David Masson and Charles Witcomb for refusing eli- sions in
      the Miltonic line, Thomas frames an argument that Milton consis- tently wrote absolute
      decasyllabic lines on the foundations of that line in Old French, Italian, Middle English, and
      Renaissance versification and on known seventeeth-century conventions of pronunciation and
      stressing. Fixity of sylla- ble-count, in short, Thomas claims to be the sole inviolable law
      of Milton's versification; Milton did not conceive of his decasyllable as an iambic one, since
      he often has more than five stresses, sometimes contiguous stresses, or fre- quently two
      inversions in a line, but it was a five-stress line, since Milton also followed "the law of a
      minimum quantity of accents." The third installment takes up variation in pause-placement both
      at mid- and end-of-line, and pho- netic harmonies. See replies by Omond and others at E1265.

     <note> In Dialogue 1, Eugenio upholds the advantages of blank verse over rhyme, then turns to
      censure excessive sound-patterning in verse, stopping along the way to praise and illustrate
      Shakespeare's versification, the sweetness of which lies in its making high artifice seem
      nothing but natural; yet, Shakespeare "in- tended it to be nothing more than a measured or
      musical prose; except, when he meant to rise to his Subject, or give a distinction to a
      thought; and then we shall always trace in his numbers the influence of his feelings." Of
      sound: it is a fault "to suffer any one letter . . . to govern entirely" a passage of verse.
      it is equally a fault to believe too literally that the sound must seem an echo to the sense:
      "the sounds should be always in accord with the sense, but they should accompany, not mimic
      it." See also E696. </note>

      be expert in (1) Elizabethan theatrical practice; (2) the textual history of the Folio; (3)

      the attention of the audience, reminding them of the fictiveness of the aesthetic artiface. In
      the second he shows how Dryden derived, from the early nondramatic couplets of "Upon the Death
      of Lord Hastings," "Astrea Redux," and "Verses to Her Highness the Duchess," a dramatic
      couplet that was (1) more varied in meter, (2) simplified in syntax and rhetoric, and (3)
      mitigated in repetitiveness by triplets, Alexandrines, etc. The three poems receive very close

     <note> Iconoclasm: Carruth argues that Pope "did everything he could, within the strict
      couplet, to relieve the jig-jog of standard pentameter"--i.e. (1) he used the apostrophe for
      all sorts of stylistic effects, and quite inconsistently, but never for mere metrical elision,
      because hiatus does occur in Pope's verse; (2) he used weak syllables in ictic position and,
      later, runs of up to three stresses followed by three slacks to break the iambic drone; and
      (3) he considered the couplet not as an "artificial" verseform but as "nearest prose," hence
      exhibiting, more than anything else, naturalness and "freedom from padding." In the early
      Pope, as Carruth shows in a brilliant demonstration, pentameters can be easily "translated"
      into tetrameters, but in the mature Pope no padding is allowed at all: every word pulls its
      weight. </note>

      is "a prosodic situation that is awkward, grotesque, and bathetic." And thus the polarizing of

     <note> The "Epistle Dedicatory of The Rival Ladies" [1664] defends the use of rhyme, taking
      Waller as authority and precedent (see vol. 1, pp. 5-8). This was an- swered by Sir Robert
      Howard, in the Preface to his Plays [1665]; Dryden countered with the indomitable Of Dramatick
      Poesie, an Essay [1668] (see vol. 1, pp. 89-107); Howard tried to rally in the Preface to his
      The Great Favorite, or, The Duke of Lerma [1668]; Dryden fired the final volley in "A Defense
      of an Essay of Dramatic Poesy," prefixed to the second edition of his The Indian Em- peror
      [1668] (vol. 2, pp. 113-18). Aureng-zebe [1676]; by the way, was the last play Dryden wrote in
      rhyme (couplets). From the Rival Ladies preface comes the famous remark that the verse must
      serve as the "clogs" for the "high-ranging Spaniel" of the imagination. "The great easiness of
      blank verse renders the poet too luxuriant; he is tempted to say many things, which might
      better be omitted, or at least shut up in fewer words; but when the difficulty of artful
      rhyming is interposed . . . the fancy then gives leisure to the judgment to come in, which,
      seeing so heavy a tax imposed, is ready to cut off all unnecessary expense." This is Dryden's
      reply to those who think rhyme "only an embroidery of sense." In the Essay of Dramatick
      Poesie, Crites attacks the use of rhyme in plays (though he will allow them in poetry) on the
      grounds that the drama follows Nature, and of course there is no natural rhyming in Speech.
      Neander (Dry- den) replies on a variety of fronts: dramatic language, he observes, is height-
      ened over that of everyday speech, so rhyme is appropriate to the stage. And the pressure of
      the formal constraints forces the verse-making poet to think ahead, thereby sharpening his
      wits. Rhyme is equally proper for plays as for poetry; it "might be made as natural as blank
      verse by the well placing of the words, etc. All the difference between them when they are
      both correct, is, the sound in one, which the other wants." From the Preface to Albion and
      Albanius [1685]: while the recitative part of opera "requires a more masculine beauty of
      expression and sound," the mu- sic "must abound in the softness and variety of numbers." "And
      yet there are rules . . . and as great a certainty of quantity in our syllables, as either in
      the Greek or Latin. . . ." Double rhymes and a symtax especially formed "for the sweetness of
      the voice" are the "main hinges" on which opera turns. The 1697 Dedication of Aeneis (vol. 2,
      esp. pp. 214-34) defends the use of triplets and Alexandrines, on the authority of Spenser and
      Cowley, men- tioning also diction in translations. The great difficulty for the imitator of
      Vir- gil is "his numbers, his choice of words, and his placing them for the sweetness of the
      sound." Dryden recommends avoidance of caesura (needed in Latin to temper the lusciousness of
      over-abundant vowels), hiatus, and monosyllabic lines. More vexingly: "I have long had by me
      the materials of an English Proso- dia, containing all the mechnical rules of versification,
      wherein I have treated, with some exactness, of the feet, the quantities, and the pauses."
      Yet, "the evil of false quantities is difficult to be cured in any modern language" (pp. 217-
      18). In the Preface to Fables Ancient &amp; Modern [1700] (vol. 2, esp. pp. 258- 59), Dryden
      compares Homer to Virgil, then asserts (mistakenly) that Chau- cer's meter is often rugged:
      his verse "is not harmonius to us" (though Dryden recognizes that it was not found so in
      Chaucer's own age). See also Dryden's poem "To the Earl of Roscommon," 11. 5-25. </note>

      splitting an oth- erwise-integral phrase, dropping syllables, adding proclitics or enclitics
      to fill out the line, or dumping excess material into the beginning of the following line

     <note> Admitting the well-known metrical, syntactic, and rhetorical accomplishments of the
      closed couplet, Jones suggests, radically, that in the larger context of the poem the couplet
      form accentually impoverishes the coherence of the whole, by the attenuations of elaboration
      and by reliance on only a single effective mode of development--logic. The "play of
      sensibility" in the verse is thus con- strained. Comparing Donne's version of his Satires to
      Pope's reveals how Donne was able to create an "interplay of verse and prose structure," the
      prose syntax having maximum play within the metrical form, whereas in Pope the verse-structure
      (pace Matthew Arnold) entirely subsumes and compels the prose statement. Extraordinary insight
      here. </note>

      (3) he learned from Waller what devices to avoid; (4) he surpassed Dryden in artistic
      self-control and craftsmanship in satire; (5) he repeated rhymes monotonously, used false
      rhymes, avoided polysyllables, and relied on conventionalized seventeenth-century rhymes too
      heavily, availing himself of the further convenience of the newer eighteenth-century changes

      1630's shows that the major develop- ment began with Tottel (1557) in translations of Ovid and
      reached its zenith, in 1590-1610, in satire and the epigram; after 1610 the incidence of the
      open couplet increases under the influence of the Tribe of Ben and John Donne. </note>

     <note> In comparison with Pope, Dryden was laxer, easier, allowing himself the ex- pansiveness
      of a triplet or Alexandrine whenever it was convenient; Pope however adopted the rule making
      "difficulties overcome more admirable than difficulties accommodated." The great advantage of
      the couplet as a form is its greater control of the reader's attention, since the reader knows
      the poet is re- sponsible for each one of the twenty syllables in every line. The early Pope
      concerned himself (in the letter to Walsh) with mimetic sound and modal verbs; the mature Pope
      preferred monosyllables--usually one of them a verb-- as rhymes, emphasized the importance of
      balance as a structural principle, and perfected the disposition of the weighty and unexpected
      polysyllable within the line. </note>

      of a metrical tradition (running from Puttenham to Byssche) fa- voring rhyme and a
      rhetorical-syntactic tradition encouraging parallelism, bal- ance, and antithesis. The great
      linchpin in the line is Ben Jonson; beside him, Waller is a "consolidator" rather than an
      innovator, whose main achievement was to shift the matter of the couplet from the paradox of
      (metaphysical )wit to the sharp bite of out-and-out antithesis. It was the joint effort of
      these two men to weld the proper rhetorical form to its proper metrical frame in the couplet.

      the use of consecutive weak syllables, the employment of half-stresses both singly and in

      examines the hypothesized retardation of the line by consonants and monosyllables, concluding
      that (1) short consonants either singly or in groups do not impair speed, whereas (2) long
      consonants, singly or in pairs, groups of three or more consonants, and any consonantal
      clusters where rapid shifting of the tongue is required do retard the line, though (3) two
      monosyllables are not a priori any harder (slower) to pronounce than a dissyllable--slowness
      depends not on word-boundaries but on phonetic patterns. See also: B212, C231, C236, C249,

     <note> Whitman's conception of verse was derived through the Transcendentalists from Coleridge
      (organic form) and the German Romantics. His practice, his meter, is derived through the
      ballads from the old native stress-meter of Old English poetry; it is thus a nonsyllabic meter
      characterized by a principle of pe- riodicity and by hovering accent, which demarcate equal
      intervals of time. Fur- ther, Whitman's poems reveal a tightly unified pyramidal structure of

      Rhythm-analysis (Corson, C. M. Lewis; psychological experiments and theories). (3) Experi-

     <note> Reflectively, the author counterpoises the unscholarly approach of McCord (E1503) to the
      wasteland of Halle-Keyser metrics (E775), deploring the latter for an abandonment of the
      necessary concept of rhythm. He then offers a con- cise formulation of McCord's observations:
      a line-break either (a) falls at the natural end of a syntactic period (phrase, clause), or
      (b) emphasizes some word or element not at the end of a phrase or clause. But in order to buy
      the latter, LaFerrière shows, free verse (with its visual prosody) must pay the great price of
      losing much of the auditory dimension of accentual-syllabic verse. The con- clusions reached

      Whitman establishes a principle of opposition be- tween the number of syntactic groups per
      line and the number of stresses per group. </note>

     <note> Section II treats rhythm in Williams' verse: its chief characteristics are "a con-
      tinuous movement and adroit timing of the beats." The use of the short line isolates and
      sharpens images, allows variations of tempo, and permits expressive use of indentation, sudden
      break-off, and white space. Morgan takes issue with Yvor Winters on the possibility of a
      free-verse meter, finding "in all true free verse . . . rhythm doing its work unsupported by
      meter." But that view forces a concession: "free-verse rhythm is but an intensification of
      prose rhythm." So, by his mode Williams has severely constricted his range of expression,
      since "the elimination of meter entails the abandonment of metrical effects, which are far
      richer and more various than free-verse effects." </note>

     <note> A subtle yet penetrating essay which suggests that in contrast to the traditional
      metrical theory of the twentieth century, derived from Hopkins and positing his conception of
      metrical pattern counterpointed against rhythmical realiza- tion, Winters devised--or
      discovered--another metrical system having two levels of counterpointing: (1) the meter
      (actually "heard," for Winters, and not an abstraction) against the rhythm of actual stresses,
      and (2) the rhythm against variations in (a) degrees of accent and (b) syllabic length. That
      is, several sam- ples of verse may have identical meter and rhythm but vary considerably in
      secondary stressing and deployment of syllabic quantity, producing markedly different textural
      effects. It was this latter aspect--a patterning of syllable length which was neither entirely
      random nor fixedly repetitive--which Winters de- veloped in his verse. The result is a dipodic
      or hierarchic structure where two levels of counterpointing are evident--the one (accentual)
      setting the primary stresses against all others, the other (accentual-syllabic) setting
      primary and sec- ondary stresses against all others. In his verse, therefore, Winters sought
      to minimize variations of meter and rhythm so as to allow the subtler free-quanti- tative
      patterns to shine through. He also experimented in blank verse, cou- plets, quatrains,
      sonnets, and the seven-syllable tetrameter line so dear to Her- rick. </note>

      This, because "as early as 1912 [Pound] began to evolve from a synthesis of Greek quantitative

     <note> Winters, managing to set aside for a space his moral objections to modern verse, turns
      to consider its achievements, limitations, and possibilities from a strictly technical point
      of view. For this he will (1) sketch out his general the- ory of verse-structure, (2) examine
      free verse of his own, his models, and his contemporaries, (3) contrast these achievements
      with those of the poets working within the great metrical tradition of the sixteenth and
      seventeenth centuries, and (4) sharpen the focus of the contrast by examining the tradi-
      tional meter developed with the greatest refinement, the heroic couplet. Summary at the end.
      Four metrical systems are recognized--quantitative, accentual, syllabic, and
      accentual-syllabic--with the permissible variations in English (accentual- syllabic) verse
      being four: substitution, secondary control of quantity, variety in degree of accent (Winters
      recognizes the Relative Stress Principle and argues for pyrrhic-spondee combinations), and
      contiguous stresses (Sprung Rhythm). Free Verse Winters views as being organized metrically on
      two levels at once, as a kind of "dipodic" verse (as Stewart would say): the patterning of
      both primary and secondary stresses is basically iambic meter, but the pattern- ing of primary
      stresses alone is the free-verse meter. But "if the ambiguity, in free verse, ceases to be a
      hesitation between alternatives. . . . [or] if the heavy beats cannot be heard as distinct
      from the light, then the free verse scheme vanishes and one has left only a fragmentary blank
      verse, badly arranged." The technical weakness of free verse are that the devices for
      variation in traditional verse--substitution and shading of accent--are not available, and
      that "the free- verse foot is very long, or is likely to be," so that "the only norm, so far
      as the structure of the foot is concerned, is perpetual variation." These deficiencies may be
      offset by "the use of lines of irregular length" and "the approximate repetition of a foot or
      of a series of feet." But Winters concludes that free verse cannot achieve the complexity and
      subtlety of tone, the range and profundity of emotion, possible in metered verse. Traditional
      meter "tends to exploit the full possibilities of language; experimental meter . . . is
      incomplete." It is only by hovering near the steadying norm that the poet can "vary his
      feelings in opposite or even in many directions." </note>

     <note> Prof. Winters explains the "loose foot" he employs in his free verse; "it consists of a
      single heavily-accented syllable, placed usually toward the fore, an unlim- ited number of
      secondarily-accented syllables, and an unlimited number of un- accented syllables." </note>
