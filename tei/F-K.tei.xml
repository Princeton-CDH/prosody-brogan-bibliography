      almost any construing of the meter one might make, and his scansions are exceedingly

      Neuphilologische Mitteilungen 70 (1969): 724–38. </bibl>
     <note> Wordsworth had "a tendency to use full or expanded forms of syntax," the chief of which
      is of + noun phrase, to express possession, instead of apostrophe + s. This form tends to slow
      down the tempo of a passage and provide psychic distancing, effects which are jointly the
      principal determiners of that mood of "reflectiveness" so frequent and so central in
      Wordsworth. In other passages, such as those of direct narration or excitement, the form
      practically disappears. For metrical reasons, the form frequently occurs at the beginning of
      the line. </note>

     <note> Passages in the critically admired "Adonais" show the same three types of vio- lations
      of syntactic constraints (the Tensed S Condition, Up-to-Ambiguity Constraint, and
      Center-Embedding), producing convoluted, awkward, even ungrammatical lines, that passages in
      the critically denigrated Laon and Cythna show, the difference being that in the latter case
      the violations are "repeated and consistent," whereas in the former they appear solely in the
      first twenty stanzas of the fifty-five stanza poem, i.e. precisely in the passage where
      Shelley portrays the world that is "untransmuted by poetic vision." In "Adonais" he controlled
      and turned to expressive use a technique hitherto uncontrolled. This essay is too long by
      half, but the section on the ambiguity of NP-NP-V constructions as lines of verse is
      enlightening. </note>

     <note> A search for dominant linguistic features as specific characteristics of style: a

      particular thematic elements in the passages in which they occur: symbolic landscape in

     <note> Rev: in Review of English Studies n.s. 20 (1969): 241–43; in Criticism 11 (1969):

      syntactic articulation are dislocation and elaboration, while the characteristic
      early-twentieth-century mode is fragmentation. A closer scrutiny is given to the contrastive

     <note> Poetic inversions are of two types--stanzaic inversions for metrical compliance and
      displacement inversions for foregrounding--for two purposes--order and marking--and via two
      means--verb or auxiliary shift, or noun-phrase inversion. Bivens shows that "the extent to
      which poetic inversion obeys the rules of or- dinary language . . . is not generally
      appreciated" by mapping out the trans- forms. But more importantly, his study avoids the
      gaudy, ephemeral, and idiosyncratic in a steady and patient search for basic principles, such
      as "the larger question of how new and old information is distributed within the sen- tence"
      [this has applications in scansion] and the rather amazing effects of the Traces Convention

      Miles is the poets' "disposition to convert verbs into noun-modifying parti- ciples," thereby

      practice is here compared to that of the other major English poets in a nearly model study

      poetry), Susanne Langer (syntax like music traces the form of experience), and Fendlosa
      (syntax symbolizes action), finding them all unsatisfactory; he then produces a typology of
      his own: syntax may be subjective (it shows us the form of the author's thought), dramatic
      (the form of someone else's thought), objective (the form of an experience or emo- tion), like
      music (showing us the form of a thought without defining it), or like mathematics (it can give
      pleasure in and of itself). Applications follow in several very short and eclectic studies.

     <note> In an intrepid performance, Davie shows that although Miltonic syntax is ca- pable of
      spectacular mimesis on occasion, leading the reader to a meaning by enacting it, in general
      neither the syntax nor the narrative structure itself in PL is designed to propel the reader
      forward or sustain his interest; indeed, "the splendidly elaborate syntax . . . in fact is
      employed characteristically to check narrative impetus and frustrate musical pleasure." Hence
      the "unifying struc- ture" of the poem is neither syntactic nor narrative, nor can it be
      "musical" in the sense of music as a structure of expectation and resolution--i.e. sustained
      progression--in time; rather, "it is a matter of vocal colouring and skillful reso- nance. . .
      . the 'music delight' is all in sonority." </note>

      in the poetic line are identified: presentational (deployment of a word for effect), imitative
      (the syntax forcing the reader to enact what is being described), and prosodic (to effect a
      rhyme, con- form to meter, or place a caesura). This last is given some further attention.

      which speakers show in interpreting poetic lines is "like learning a language," or better,
      like learning "an unfamiliar dialect of one's own language": "one seeks to discover

      Francis observes that when readers of poetry confront a difficult passage, they usually try to
      surmount it by paying attention to lexical meanings or logical structure, but rarely by paying
      attention simply to syntax. He catches Kenneth Burke at this, and then gauges the skills of
      several other critics of Thomas's "Altarwise by Owl-light," giving a close reading himself.

      show that the (syntactic) ellipsis of one element in a sentence can generate the possibility
      of ambiguity in other elements, which, lacking such a deletion, would otherwise not be open to
      multiple meaning. So the deletion of on in Hopkins' "fastened [on] me flesh" creates such an
      ambi- guity, a "phonological ellipsis," namely "fashioned me flesh." In effect syntactic
      compression allows phonological expansion which enhances semantic richness. </note>

      dislocation, as between determiner and noun) to "softest," (respectively) six to one
      numerically. Determinations of hardness, however, are complex matters, given the syntactic
      ambiguities which Milton systematically exploits at line-end: we have learned very well how a

     <note> Syntactic deviations in poetry are of two types: "those produced against the conventions
      of the poem." The first type, which Riffaterre has treated in terms of microcontext and
      macrocontext, is not a satisfactory concept, nor is the second if it approached purely
      statistically, since statistical norms for syntax in the lan- guage as a whole are simply
      impracticable. "But not all ungrammatical se- quences are poetically deviant . . . poetic
      deviation is in some sense controlled." Hence the standard for deviation should be the
      determinate norm of a genera- tive grammar of the language. </note>

      misleading. . . . Additional models . . . are called for . . . ." The crux of the problem,

     <note> Implicitly or explicitly syntax has always been a part of English verse-theory,
      especially for Old English, but even "where a metrical principle is not percep- tible, as in
      most modern verse, the description and definition of rhythms be- comes impossible unless we
      take grammar into consideration." Earlier proso- dists offer little help, though Scripture's
      "centroid" captures the idea of the phrase-coalescing stress. Probably enjambement is only a
      matter of degree, every line having at least some minimal pause at its end. Mitchell gives a
      ten- tative sketch of a taxonomy for English verse (pp. 18–19), with illustrations. </note>

      couplet. Since structures of identity (stasis) such as repetition, parallel- ism, balance, and

      example "pseudo-parallelism" and "pseudo- antithesis," structures whose actual effect is
      exactly the opposite of what it seems. The essence of the couplet is a "serial form" with
      "constant progres- sion." More generally, two modes of poetic organization may be defined,
      "open syntax" and "closed syntax," the open form emphasizing objects, things, quiddities,
      nouns, the closed form conversely attentive to connections, change, process (this the Augustan

     <note> Does epistemology determine grammar in Blake? There is visual direction, and then there
      is grammatical direction. But directionality in both cases is anything but simple: an engraver
      might be expected to be sensitive to visual reversals, and images can be "read" in several
      configurations, but a word can be modified in several directions simultaneously, and in fact
      words often have "an internal order of meaning independent of the horizontal flow of the
      sentence." Lan- guage too is susceptible of reversal, and of multiple directionality. Finally,
      neither syntax nor image partakes of "single vision" in Blake: "The design of vision has no
      natural setting any more than it has anything to do with natural religion." </note>

     <note> "The characteristic sound in Stevens' poetry depends to a surprising extent upon a
      single thing: the capacity for complex syntax . . . . The phenomenon is a matter of the most
      exquisite balances, for the parts are at once immediate yet surprising, while the whole is
      simultaneously complex and satisfying. This dramatic balance gives Stevens a superb aesthetic
      instrument, for he can vary its effect almost endlessly by shifting complexity from design to
      detail and sim- plicity from detail to design . . . . Since the balances in a poem are
      sequential rather than causal, and so can only be momentarily achieved, the poem's pros- ody
      must not offer the slightest resistance to reaching them . . . the prosodic resonance is all
      outward and discontinuous since what there is of it in itself is wholly implicit in the
      momentary balances between detail and design." </note>

      internal dynamics of the stanza, taking Sidney's poems and those of the major Renaissance
      miscellanies as texts. The author anatomizes (1) structural (or logical) relations between
      stanzas in a poem, grading the connectedness as "unfixed," "light-stimulus," or
      "strong-stimulus," with a notation for marking these; (2) reiteration of key words or phrases
      in and across stanzas; and (3) the structure within a stanza, especially vis à vis the problem
      of rhyme. </note>

     <note> A companion-work to Turco (G59), yet of considerably greater range and penetration.
      Häublein reviews the major critical opinions on stanza-form from Puttenham (E614) to the
      present and surveys the characteristics of the major forms, but his principal interest
      throughout is the functions and effects--the dynamics--of stanzas, a province virtually
      unexplored to date. He examines modes of unification, varieties of openings and endings,
      structural repetition, and the "framing" effect within the stanza, and forms of linkage and
      develop- ment between stanzas in a poem. Well informed; extensive examples. </note>

     <note> Herbert devised a strategy of counterpointing his stanzas (abstract patterns of
      line-lengths, e.g. abab) to his rhymes (also abstract patterns, e.g. abba). As a re- sult,
      "this clash of patterns, this countrapuntal music" seems designed to pro- mote the sense
      before the pleasing sounds of the poem, thereby insuring the alertness of the reader. The
      sources: Puttenham's theory and Donne's practice. Hayes identifies twenty-seven varieties of
      stanza in The Temple, concluding, from an examination of twelve other major poets, that
      Herbert's contrapuntal stanza-structure is nearly nonexistent in the rest of English poetry.
      Compare this study with that by Kiparsky on abstract patterns (B117). </note>

      Chaucerian rhyme royal (it appears in the June and No- vember eclogues); the sixth-line

     <note> Spenser devised an aural structure equally as distinctive and important as, yet in
      counterpoint and tension to, the visual structure of his stanza: against the so- lidity and
      uniformity of the structure of line-lengths, he set in opposition ir- regularities of
      stressing, caesura placement, and enjambment to create variety. Another device: the repetition
      of short metrical "motifs" to link stanzas; this device Spenser learned from music, since the
      strophic poem set to music re- quires metrical repetition to correspond to the repeated
      phrasings in the mel- ody. Seems to be a study of metrical variation. </note>

      some of the sonnets of these poets were intended to be linked, but on the other hand the

      pear which may or may not have been intended, even beyond those that ap- pear in sonnets that

      syntactically only to the closest preceding lines, and the rhyme form is clearly 8–6, so that
      in both poets the sonnets show both Italian and English characteristics. Their sonnets have,

      on the evolution of technique in the sonnet from Wyatt to Donne, but with chief interest in
      the sonneteers of the 1580s and '90s. He examines (1) non-metrical pause placement, both
      intralinear and end-of-line; (2) stress variations on the iamb; and (3) consonant alliteration
      and vowel harmony (see also Appendix A). The author uses Mayor's (E592) 0-1-2 scansion system,
      yet Saintsbury is the authority most cited and approved. Conclusion: the sonnet- eers
      purposefully aimed for variation both in meter and internal caesura place- ment, while
      line-end pauses decreased in number yet were more effectively employed. The data here is

      the metrical development of the early sonneteers, but it is hard--very hard--to draw away from
      Lever's refulgent book. The first chapter, on Wyatt, is devoted largely to versification;
      thereafter, mainly pp. 86–87, 134–35, and 145. </note>

      than analysis (such as this) of the deployment of syntactic and semantic material within the
      frames of rhyme and stanza. Levý examines the "internal morphol- ogy" of the sonnets of the
      eleven major Renaissance sonneteers, then com- pares their practices with those of three later
      English poets and six Continental ones. No radically new conclusions emerge, but a number of
      significant ones do, and in general the article synthesizes, concisely and accessibly, a
      wealth of information--far more than most English critics put into whole books. </note>

     <note> The longevity of the sonnet's form is explained by the fact that it (1) controls and (2)
      enriches the experience being presented. The control resides in order; the form evokes a
      unified response, based on numerous sub-levels of organiza- tion. Each level groups fewer than
      six of its units, which is in fact the maximum number of units perceptible in the human
      attention span. The Gestalt criteria of nearness, likeness, sequence, and closure are also met
      in the rhyme scheme. The enrichment resides in the pleasure of perceiving "equipollence," the
      series of "internal balances" the sonnet maintains both within and among its levels of
      organization. </note>

     <note> A tripartite work: the first section discusses the sonnet tradition in general, while
      the second (about 75 pages) focuses on a close analysis of Keats's han- dling of the sonnet,
      and the third (Appendix) prints the texts of the 67 sonnets Keats wrote. There are also
      incidental observations on the sonnet techniques of Hunt, Bowles, Wordsworth, Milton,
      Shakespeare, and Spenser in Appendix II. Keats at sonnets was relatively conservative,
      following the views of the age- -and especially Hunt--pretty closely. It is not generally
      known that he only turned to the Shakespearean form after writing nearly 40 of his 67 or so
      son- nets in the Italian form. Zillman's study of Keats's prosody is narrower in focus and
      less stylish but more detailed than Bate's (B7), often providing tables of information on
      sound patterning, alliteration and assonance, rhyming, metrical variation, end-stopping,

     <note> Random sampling of such a correlation in a large number of poets produces an average:
      95% in non-shaped poetry vs. 68% in shaped poetry. Conclusion: "when the poet becomes
      preoccupied with the visual image of the poem upon the page, the correlation between line and
      syntax is substantially lower than when the visual shape of the poem on the page is dictated
      by nonvisual criteria, i.e. by the number of syllables in the line, by phrasal units, by
      notions of rhythm analogous to "isochronous units," etc. </note>

     <note> If prosody comprises the "total rhythmic form" of a poem then everything which affects
      that form is by definition prosodic, including white space, lineation, paragraphing, spatial
      deployment of lines, and--especially-- punctuation, since the pointing controls both the
      temporal positioning and pacing of elements and also the sense. "To alter the poem's
      punctuation is to alter the poem's prosody, and, hence, its meaning," as can be shown by
      constructing twin dummy models of poems which differ only in punctuation. </note>

      "reading" of the shape of poems (in the sense in which art critics talk about "reading" or
      "scanning" a painting) which is so crucial for our determinations of meter and genre. There is
      the long tradition of poems picturing things--the pattern poems of the Renaissance, the
      concrete poetry of our own century--but then again there is the central visuality of syllabic
      verse and free verse, the importance of which far surpasses mere picturing by form in its deep
      access to the structure and nature--both quidditas and haecceitas--of the poem. After all, "a

      visually and aurally--spatially and temporally. These designs are conventional strategies of
      structure, not particularly connected to Concretism; they entail adding, repeating, or

      An early study of what we would now term "breath-groups." The great rhythmic activities of the
      body are the breath and the heartbeat, four of the latter for each of the former. Reading
      octosyllabic verse, one takes about 20 breaths per minute to read about 20 lines per minute,
      thus making, by equiva- lence of the breath and line, such verse very easy to read. Iambic
      pentameter verse goes more slowly, since longer, and is thereby more fatiguing, but cae- suras
      are available as compensations. Ballad meters are hemistichic and easy; the duodecasyllabic
      line is rarely used because it is too long for one breath but too short for two. Finally, as
      line corresponds to breath, so accent may corre- spond to pulse--four pulses to the breath
      equal four stresses to the octosyllable. Certainly it is true that in the oral delivery of
      verse one must accomo- date the phrasal contours to one's breath; the question is whether such
      biologi- cal rhythms were the primal origins of meter. </note>

      the 1956 Kenyon Review symposium (E712) as a examplar of the new interest by structural
      linguists in metrics. These linguists, armed with the Trager-Smith inventory of supraseg-
      mentals, believe that the meter was to be discovered by reading the poem aloud, and Chatman
      himself insists that ambiguity exists only on paper and is instantly resolved in oral
      performance. Levin's response is to distinguish lexical ambiguity (which no performance will
      disambiguate) from syntactic ambiguity (which is resolved in reading). Thereafter, he can only
      plead that ambiguity is an intentional device of intensification in poetry, and that insofar
      as oral per- formance reduces ambiguity, it performs "a real disservice to the poem." Am-
      biguity is preserved in "visual performance . . . a silent reading." The latter half of the

      line one way one time). Loesch shows that "it is rarely, if ever, the case that only
      disambiguating intonations are avail- able. A non-disambiguating intonation is always
      available as well." This seems plain sense: unless we had heard ambiguous statements uttered,

      both inherently "futile" (given the considerable range of variations) and also inferior to the
      truly important work of explanation (which Sievers of course did not attempt)--Baum undertakes
      "a fresh examination of the data" (very limited data, one must add); on the assumptions that
      the verse was (1) spoken not sung, (2) based on 2 stresses per verse, with (3) emphasis on the
      al- literation, he concludes that (1) the half-line is in every respect the unit of meter--the
      long line is not one line but a couplet; (2) the promotion and sup- pression of secondary
      accents is the very heart of the whole metrical system; (3) Sievers erred in confusing meter
      with rhythm--the Five Types are varieties of rhythm, not meter, meter being a much more
      simplified pattern; (4) the meter of OE is simply a verse of 2 stresses in up to 5 syllables,
      everything else being variable; and (5) the two most distinctive qualities of OE verse are
      "its freedom or elasticity and its heavy pounding." </note>

     <note> A "brief survey" by one who believes that "detailed examination can properly be left to
      the scientists." Thus our modern-day Saintsbury gives here an analy- sis that like his others
      is based on representative samples and indeed goes that far only in order to satisfy "those
      who wish everything neat and tidy" (Sievers' typology is disparaged thus throughout.)
      Everything is really very simple. In Beowulf we find "not a rigid meter but a rather loose and
      easy manner"; "the basic pattern of the verse is generally two-stress trochaic," i.e. "verses
      with two stresses and a varying number of unstressed syllables." But there are many
      variations. It is unlikely that the scop "used his harp as a metronome," since Gregorian chant
      uses non-isochronic measures. Baum notes the common pat- terns of normal, double, triple,
      transverse, and plurilinear alliteration but rejects the rule (from Rieger) that it is the
      first stave of the second verse which de- termines the alliteration, citing fifty examples.
      Similarly he rejects the idea of resolution and behind it any attention to syllabic quantity
      in scansion. The hy- permetrical lines he thinks vestiges of the oldest Proto-Germanic line of
      eight beats. </note>

      chanting of the verse could have been a percussive, monotonal rhythmic base, a full melody or
      tune sung along with the words, or, more likely, some "vestigial melodic and rhythmic aid to
      the singer"; Cable (J42) has explored this last possibility the most fully. </note>

     <note> On one of the most beguiling questions in English versification. Bliss, assum- ing that
      the difference between Old and Modern English meter lies in the fact that the former achieves
      variety "not in the more or less exact accommodation of the speech-material to the metrical
      pattern, but in the variation of the met- rical pattern itself," that pattern being not an
      artificial, abstract form but a re- production of the pattern of actual speech itself [Bliss
      agrees with Daunt], pro- ceeds to argue that, in fact, Old English and Modern English meters
      are not really dissimilar, since both rely au fond on the natural rhythms of the language,
      which in this respect have not changed significantly since before the Conquest, and also,
      since many combinations of OE verse-types can be scanned as pass- able iambic pentameters and
      vice versa. After all, Chaucer can hardly have learned the regular alternation of stresses and
      slacks from French verse, where no such principle exists; a much more likely source is the
      regular alternation inherent in OE verse itself, as when resolution occurs in the C and D
      types. </note>

      work (below): here he partitions then discusses Rhythm (consist- ing of Stress, both
      sentence-stress and word-stress, and Quantity), Phrasing (breath-groups divided by caesuras,
      usually two groups to the verse (or half- line), and Alliteration. On Metre, he takes as the
      Rhythm Sievers' Five Types and as the Phrasing (one stress to each breath-group) three
      possibilities for placement of the caesura inside the verse. Of the fifteen possible
      combinations of these two systems, Bliss finds eight in actuality. </note>

      Lewis (J172). A "triumphant vindication" and revision of Sievers. Bliss reclassifies the
      verses (half-lines) in Beowulf as being comprised of 1, 2, or 3 principal stresses and terms
      them (respectively) Light, Normal, and Heavy. He also argues that the loss of a stress in
      Light verses entails an increase in the number of syllables in the verse "if the average
      interval between stresses is to remain constant." But in notation Bliss uses the vertical bar
      (oddly termed the "caesura," which is nothing but unhelpful) not to divide metrical units
      (Sievers called them "feet") but to mark the "breath-groups" (roughly corresponding to
      word-boundaries). He prefixes the numbers 1, 2, and 3 to the Five Types designations to
      indicate (respectively) that the first breath-group is shorter than, equal to, or longer than
      the second. This procedure yields eight major varieties: 1A, 2A, 2B, 3B, 2C, 1D, 2E, and 3E.
      For the hypermetrical verses, Bliss suggests that the final syllables of ordinary verses are
      replaced by a wide variety of extensions. The 2nd edition adds an Appendix (E) in which Bliss
      reaffirms that the base or norm of OE verse is the normal, falling-rhythm Type A, very common,
      and that the scop deliberately counterpoised it against the other types for the sake of
      variety, repeating the A type often enough to keep the norm visible. </note>

     <note> Extending his earlier hypothesis (J22) of an Old Norse origin (the ljóðaháttr meter) for
      the single half-lines which occasionally appear in OE poetry, Bliss suggests further that
      "there is sufficient likeness between the Old English hy- permetric long line and the Old
      Norse ljóðaháttr couplet to make it possible that both are derived from one and the same
      prehistoric Germanic metre," which Bliss reconstructs hypothetically as: / (X) / | (X) / X / X
      || (X) / X / X . Since OE hypermetric alliteration is continued but that for the ON ljóðaháttr
      - couplet is double, two types must have been equally preferable in the proto- meter: three
      staves (one on the first stress of each section of the line) or four (two sets of pairs).

     <note> In OE poetry short lines (i.e. single verses) are much more frequent than most editors
      recognize, Bliss argues; they are especially frequent in the Maxims. The source for this
      device may well be the Old Norse ljóðaháttr meter, where short lines are very common; the
      distribution of alliteration in the OE lines also matches that in the ON. </note>

     <note> Based on his dissertation at Texas in 1969, "Old English Meter: Problems, Principles,
      and Abstract Form in Beowulf." DAI 30 (1970): 5401A. The heir-apparent to Sievers' title,
      Cable reaffirms then extends the work of the master, accepting (initially) the Five Types
      theory as "real," but also ac- cepting the older view of the viergliedrige [four-member] Vers
      (which Kaluza, Sievers, and other before them held). Cable presents a series of six
      preliminary, discrete arguments refining Sievers' Types to a final synthesis of them which
      attempts to explain what Sievers could only describe with his typology, through a single
      principle which will both (1) generate the Five Types and (2) exclude all other possibilities.
      This principle is the postulate that in a four-member verse the first of two clashing stresses
      must always be heavier. Cable is able to show, then, by this and by applying Jespersen's
      notation to the Five Types, that five and only five "contours" are produced: A 1 \ 2 / 3 \ 4 B
      1 / 2 \ 3 / 4 C 1 / 2 \ 3 \ 4 D 1 \ 2 \ 3 \ 4 E 1 \ 2 \ 3 / 4. These contours are a refinement
      of the Five Types, which "are not the meter but the inevitable result of the meter, which is a
      four-unit pattern." Ca- ble hypothesizes further that these gradations in the meter must have
      been sig- naled not by stress or timing or length but by pitch; the meter, that is, corre-
      lates with melody rather than rhythm, and the five contours were in fact me- lodic formulae
      used by the scop as accompaniment to his words. This is an in- trepid thesis, backed by an
      argument that is short in length but very incisive. The resolution of its focus is remarkable.
      For critique, however (the only one to appear so far), see Hoover (J131). The six arguments
      which Cable executes in his first six chapters (re- spectively) as "minor surgery" to the
      Five-Types Theory are: (1) OE is not a simple stress-meter; the number of weak syllables is
      not unconstrained; (2) Every verse (half-line) must have at least two stresses (Bliss's
      "light" verses are rejected entirely); (3) The most crucial observation about OE meter,
      preceding even the formulation of the Five Types, is that the scop avoided utterly the pattern
      X / X / X ; the meter must screen out this pattern, therefore, since it is very common in OE
      prose; (4) Secondary stress is metrically relevant, espe- cially for a distinction between
      Type E and certain subtypes of Type A; (5) As a general rule, the first of two clashing
      stresses must always be the stronger, es- pecially for Types C and D; and (6) Types D2 and E
      are metrically indistin- guishable and should be combined, leading to the wider inference that
      the verse consists of four and only four glieder (members or positions, not syllables).

      determined by its grammatical category. More specifically, he quarrels with S. O. Andrew for
      believing that adverbs are always metrically stressed and with A. J. Bliss, on the other hand,
      for the converse assumption, which pro- duces his "light" lines (also questioned here). As a
      medial corrective, Cable proposes two rules for syntactic structures containing the word þa as
      adverb and conjunction, such that the word may be metrically variable--either stressed or
      unstressed--according to its syntactic context. Thus the absolutism of each extreme is
      avoided, and the rules turn out to have greater conceptual elegance in terms of simplicity,
      consistency, and scope. </note>

      last four are additions by the author's brother William. Conybeare's view is essentially that
      Old English verse is written in a meter based on emphasis rather than quantity, a meter which
      measures the line in feet which begin with stresses--i.e., a trochaic- dactylic meter. He also
      recognizes the importance of alliteration and parallelism as indispensable structural
      elements. The verse is set as hemistichs, though, rather than as the full lines familiar to
      us, Conybeare thinking the question merely one of typography. In the four essays added
      posthumously, William sur- veys Icelandic, Scandinavian, Germanic, and Celtic meters (this

     <note> Old English meter, unlike Modern English, must be defined "in terms of other
      phonological levels than the phonetic," levels such as the syntactic and seman- tic, to be
      fully intelligible. Its "output," to speak in Cosmos's transformational terms, was
      simultaneously the formulae of oral composition and the stress- schemata of the meter.
      Syllable-counting, which is so evident in Eddic and Scaldic verse, in Otfrid, and in the
      medieval Latin hymn-meters, is alien to the native Old English metrical system and only
      appears in the later OE poetic monuments under the influence of Latin. </note>

     <note> A major re-assessment of the validity and adequacy of Kuhn's Law of Sentence Particles
      in the terms of modern linguistic theory shows convincingly that the problem of unstressed
      finite verbs is much more adequately accounted for in terms of utterance analysis and
      "communicative dynamism" [i.e., the extent to which a given word "propels" the sense of the
      sentence forward partly deter- mines the phonological prominence of that word] than via the
      older gram- matical (word-class) approach, which is finally not very helpful. Distinguishing
      between "lexical and nonlexical verb roots," Cosmos shows that "the finite forms of lexical
      verbs normally occur in positions of metrical ictus in Beowulf, that nonlexical verbs, on the
      other hand, occur in metrically stressed positions only under very specific circumstances, and
      finally that unstressed lexical verbs occur as a function of very general principles of
      utterance organization." An outstanding study. </note>

     <note> Repeated attempts to find a metrical system sufficiently simple as to be work- able for
      schoolroom use lead the author to devise a more (conceptually) ele- gant codification of
      Pope's obstreperous system (J242), in fact a model with only six types of measures: alpha: / X
      gamma: / \ X epsilon: (/) X beta: / X \ delta: / (X) alpha prime: / \ . These correspond to
      the Sievers Types thus: Creed Sievers alpha + alpha A1 epsilon + beta B epsilon + gamma C
      delta + gamma Da delta + beta Db gamma + delta E epsilon + alpha A3. Creed can give four
      relatively simple rules for finding the primary stresses and measure boundaries, and a fifth
      for resolution. Two measures make a verse. Notice that the delta type is actually an alpha
      with the weak syllable re- placed by a rest or harpbeat; similarly, the epsilon is an alpha
      with a harpbeat for the stress. The six types may then be classed into two groups, beta and
      gamma comprising Group II and the other four Group I. The possibility of trisyllabic
      substitution in each position can then be shown to obtain in the measures of Group I, but not
      of Group II. A simple and efficient account of the conditions for anacrusis is also then
      possible. See also L744. </note>

      the same: the real effect is one of similarity-within-difference, and we may expect that at
      the point where the audience recognized the appearance of a distinctive formula they set it,
      more or less instantaneously, within the context of all the other instances of the same theme

      patterns and, in fact, to Mod- ern English ones as well; the types can be found easily in OE
      prose, in Shake- speare, in Modern English speech, and in jingles. [But to say that OE poetry
      "was made with pieces of language" is one thing, and to say that such making is therefore not

      appear; different OE poems show idiosyncratic preferences in alliteration; there is a tendency
      to continue alliteration into groups longer than the line; the Anglian characteristics of Beo-
      wulf merit further study; the last non-alliterating stress in a line sometimes "picks up" the
      alliteration in the next full line; and sometimes the non- alliterating stresses of two lines
      also happen to alliterate. Preliminary statistics for most of these features. </note>

      structural alliteration in Old English poetry. Clearly such patterns are significant. Ehrstine
      identifies (not very clearly) six varieties of "sub- alliteration": (1) repetition of weak
      prefixes, and "crossed alliteration"; (2) as- sonantal and consonantal repetition within the
      line; (3) a minor sound is pat- terned then (noticed? and) picked up as the main alliteration;
      (4) larger pat- terns; (5) very similar sounds (e.g. m-n) in adjacent lines; and (6)
      ornamental clustering of a non-structural alliteration within a half-line. Cf. Conner (J54).

     <note> When Sievers set about to give a general account of the relation of metrical stressing
      to syntax in OE verse he sorted the various parts of speech into three
      classes--always-stressed (substantives, etc.), variable (verbs, adverbs), and rarely- stressed
      (prolitics, pronouns, etc.). Kuhn's Law of Sentence Particles also treated these latter two
      classes. But a much more systematic and detailed ex- amination of Class III-forms than that
      given by either Sievers or Kuhn reveals that their rules are not only unreasonably rigid but
      also "in part erroneous and genuinely misleading." These lesser sentential elements "offer so
      much range in position and metrical value as to impart that variety and liveliness of
      expression which raise mere versification to compositional art." Cf. Stanley (J300). </note>

     <note> A concise and convenient comparison of the three principal modern theories of OE meter,
      Sievers, Heusler, and Pope. Funke notes that though Heusler ac- cepted Sievers' view that the
      poetry was recited not sung, there are differences between them, especially concerning
      "contractions." The differences between Heusler's system and Pope's modification of it is that
      Heusler considers the anacrusis extrametrical, while Pope includes it in the meter. This
      slight shift has enormous consequences rhythmically. </note>

     <note> Regardless of whether or not the verses of Beowulf show formulaic (lexical) structure,
      they conform to a simpler underlying paradigm of syntactic identity containing 29 syntactic
      verse-formulae. The scop's formulaic lexicon, it seems, is derived from a formulaic
      syntax/verse-structure. Five of these 29 syntactic patterns, all of which are based on the
      syntactic relation of the two words in the verse bearing primary stress, occur over 400 times
      each (in 3500 verses) in Beowulf. </note>

     <note> In the midst of an argument that the only adequate form for translating Anglo- Saxon
      verse is a direct imitation of the features of the alliterative meter (blank verse is too
      modern, intellectual, and literary, and ballad-meter and simple stress-meter are alien),
      appears an altogether extraordinary digression (pp. 53– 70), in which Gummere broaches the
      whole question of the early evolution of English verse. Following the map laid down by
      Schipper, he undertakes to show that English verse-structure "is simply the result of forcing
      the iambic pentameter movement (influence of foreign models played its part here) upon some
      late form of our old four-stress verse." The older four beats, in short, can still be heard
      under the more recent five. Recent research has suggested that this view is wrong, possibly
      entirely wrong, and if so, one is led to confront head-on the huge question of what the
      history (nature) of our verse really was (is). Gummere also gives close attention to Spenser's
      Shepheardes Calendar. ---- Halle, Morris, and Samuel J. Keyser. "Old English Alliterative

      Single alliteration is rare. But to treat these lines as Pope and Bliss do--i.e., as having

      when these outer members are removed. </note>

     <note> Creed and Pope's treatment of hypermetric verses as "double time" measures leads to
      several kinds of unsatisfactory results, such as overweighting. But if we treat them as having
      three stresses (and measures) instead of two in each half- line, these difficulties will be
      removed and certain other regular features will become evident: (1) there are no more than
      four syllables in any measure; (2) double alliteration is frequent in the on-verse; (3) the
      first stress in the off-verse is regularly non-alliterative; and (4) the effect on tempo is to
      quicken the opening of the verse but weight its end. In any event there does seem to be a
      distinct rhythmical shift in the hypermetrical passages. That such lines are in fact clustered
      is some additional support for distinguishing them. </note>

      of compound words in order to show that whenever a secondary accent falls between two arses
      (i.e. syllables outside of the ictic positions), or between an arsis and a pause at the
      verse-end, the secondary accent on that syllable is metrically demoted or suppressed. (The
      corollary, promotion of such syllables when they are in ictic positions, he does not

      seem. Publishing his work soon after Siev- ers', Kaluza intends to reconcile the Five Types
      description of stress-patterns, which he considered irrefragable, with the older
      vierhebungstheorie by adjusting the emphasis of the latter somewhat to call for four members
      in the verse rather than four beats. But in order to do so he is forced to construct a
      typology of 90 subtypes, which later scholars have understandably found too unwieldy to use.
      The full theory is revised and expanded in A3 and can be most conveniently consulted in A4,
      the English translation. The success of Kaluza's synthesis, however, is open to question even
      aside from the ponderous bulk of his own system. The dispute between the vierhebungstheorie
      and zweihebungstheorie schools had arisen precisely over the issue of whether the Old Germanic
      line consisted of four stresses (two major and two minor) or only two (major). In this the
      dispute may seem nearly tau- tological and synthesis easy. But Kaluza, with a gesture toward
      the old Indo- Germanic ur-meter x / | x / | x / | x / | as the fullest form, being reduced and
      corrupted over time, trivializes the whole issue and only effects his syn- thesis by what
      looks very much like a lexical feint, in claiming that the term member (German glied--the word
      originally referred to the members of the human body) should be substituted for the term beat
      (hebung). That substitution enables Kaluza to speak of the OE verse as a four-member verse,
      regardless of stresses, a formulation that has been much approved of later. But it is one
      thing to speak of members, in the sense of abstract metrical positions, and quite an- other to
      speak of linguistic stresses, particularly in metrics. Calling oranges ap- ples will not
      change their taste. Kaluza is right to deplore quibbling about terms but wrong to duck the
      questions of whether the bar (measure, foot) consists of one syllable or two and whether the
      stresses of the alternate bars al- ternate dipolically. Takt does not equal glied. And after
      all, Kaluza's own para- digm for the verse consists of four members divided into two feet
      (Fusse), each foot beginning with a stress. Does, then, takt = fuss? A difference, it has been
      said, ought to make a difference. </note>

     <note> Reply by Luick in 22 (1896): 332; rejoinder by Kaluza, pp. 333–34. Kaluza's account of
      the hypermetrical lines in OE verse can be more conven- iently studied in A4. His position is
      that Sievers was originally correct to inter- pret the form as a normal verse preceded by an
      irregular number of syllables but incorrect in trying to regularize this initial section: we
      must simply call it an "extended anacrusis." The present essay catalogues the known instances.
      The difficulty with this view is that Kaluza allows the first alliteration and pri- mary
      stress of the line to fall in the "extended anacrusis," which seems an un- reasonable
      extension of the sense of "anacrusis." </note>

      correlates to be about twenty lines, but the preponderance of them echo at from five lines to
      ten, and the phenome- non is consistently evident in both early and late OE poetry. By far, it
      is the identical word that is repeated, though the lesser echoes of etymologues and analogues
      all contribute to larger complexes or "echoic sets." </note>

     <note> Rev: in Anglia Beiblatt 4 (1893): 193–201. From an examination of the metrical pointing
      in the manuscript Codex Junius XI, Lawrence takes the position (following Möller [L505]
      explicitly) that the alliterative line is divided twice (into quarters), rather than once
      (into half- lines), each section being comprised of four Moren (a More = the duration of one
      short syllable) and a primary and a secondary stress: / x \ x | / x \ x | / x \ x | / x \ x |
      If syllables are absent, the time is filled by rests. Chapter One is a useful introduction to
      the state of the controversy among philologists of the time. Subsequent chapters treat Crossed
      Alliteration and Vowel Alliteration (Middle English poems compared to Beowulf). </note>

     <note> Word-final resonants present a familiar problem in methodology for metrical research:
      almost the only available evidence for early stages of the language lies in poetic texts, and
      we do not know a priori if forms therein represent the stan- dard language or artificial
      convention, or even (given the MSS) if the poet and scribe were ever consistent in usage.
      Therefore, the linguistic evidence must be assessed before any metrical evidence is
      considered. On this basis Lehmann concludes that l, m, n, and r possessed full syllabic value
      for metrical purposes after heavy syllables, but not after light ones. This will lead to a
      reassessment of the metrical status of a considerable number of lines in Beowulf. </note>

     <note> Rev: by Klaeber in Anglia Beiblatt 32 (1921): 145–48. Begin at section G. For his
      translation of Beowulf the poet-critic Leonard chose the eight-beat, hemistichic,
      couplet-rhymed long-line of the Niebelungenlied; he therefore accepts what Kaluza called
      "the-good-old-much-despised-and-
      often-pronounced-dead-but-on-this-account-only-so-much-the-more-
      tenaciously-clinging-to-life-Lachmannian-four-accent-theory." But unlike Trautmann (a teacher
      of Leonard's), who alone believed that all four of the stresses in the half-line were weighted
      equally, Leonard's view is that they are dipodic: two are primary, and two others are lesser
      stresses, but nevertheless stresses. Thus the difference between his view and Sievers' is
      merely one of how to treat the intermediary stresses--whether as weaker than full, but still
      stronger than weakest, or as weaker than full, hence weak. Leonard prefers the gravity,
      solemnity, and slowness which overstressing gives to the poetic line. The little children's
      rhyme given on p. 133 says everything in a nutshell. See Leonard's later articles (K215 and
      L461) and Stewart's article (E379) and book (E333). There is a criticism of his position in

     <note> ; rpt Folcroft, Pa.: Folcroft Library Editions, 1969. 104 pp. His dissertation at Yale,
      1897. Around the turn of the century, interest ran high in philological circles on the
      question of the primitive origins of poetry (F. B. Gummere published an important book). Lewis
      is interested not in the earliest (Hebrew) syllabic versification nor in the (later) classical
      quantitative system (Greek, then taken over into Latin), but in the origin of the modern
      accentual versification. Several theories had been proposed for this major shift in
      verse-technique in the early Middle Ages, for it was not immediately obvi- ous how an
      accentual system could evolve from a quantitative one, if at all; some believed the two
      systems had no connection at all, the accentual system deriving from another foreign source or
      from vernacular Latin poetry (which was accentual). Lewis examines the crude Commodian verse
      of the mid third century, the Latin hymns of Ambrose and the later high-medieval Church music,
      and Old French syllabic verse in order to demonstrate the genealogy of the native, Old English
      verseform (that is, before the French modification of the native form after the Norman
      Conquest). The disintegration of classical Latin quantitative verse into a looser, accentually
      rhythmical form often remains obscure at points, and we can see that medieval music is still
      not entirely un- derstood, but Lewis manages to establish his line of descent from the high
      Latin forms through to the sophisticated and complex artistic form of the Old English line.

     <note> Randolph Quirk's suggestion (J243) that lexical collocations tend to appear as
      alliterants in OE meter can be restated as a general rule--"linguistic connection complements
      metrical connection"--that will permit a superior account of certain lines than that given by
      the nine types of "light verses" distinguished by Bliss (J20). The fact is, traditional
      metrical analyses such as his tend to assign stress to syllables on the basis of relatively
      rigid phonetic and syntactic laws, such as Kuhn's Law for particles. But, arguably, the
      context--the specific lin- guistic and metrical environment--is also very influential. The
      grammatical rules are not inviolable; they interact with prosodic conventions such as allit-
      eration, lexical collocations, and formulae. Bliss's light verses can be accounted for by such
      factors as these latter, since itself "alliteration is a signal of corre- spondence between

     <note> In the earliest, oral stages of OE poetry, alliteration served primarily metrical ends,
      whereas later, in the literate stage, it served to conjoin grammatically and thematically
      important items. These latter functions were served even further by extending the (originally
      linear) alliteration into "plurilinear" units, thereby sustaining the theme or mood over a
      greater expanse. </note>

     <note> Following Malone (J198) [without citing him], Lewis proceeds to identify four varieties
      of alliteration within a two-line span--enjambed, reverse-enjambed or "envelope," a
      free-position type, and something very close to end-rhyme. But he dismisses out of hand the
      probabilities for occurrence of these phenomena based on random chance, a matter which C. M.
      Lewis (J170) and Emerson (J78) have shown to be highly relevant. Stronger proof is required
      that this is not mere fortuitous, residual, or morphologically-determined ornamentation.

      (Notre Dame), which is abstracted in Linguistics 15 (1965): 116–18. Taking the position that
      the meter of Old English poetry is "a pattern of four members having two phrase stresses and
      making up a short, phrasal line- unit called a verse," Luecke proceeds through a detailed
      (though misleading) history of Old English metrical studies to her thesis, the argument that
      the Heusler-Pope school of "musical" metrists applies its theory--or analogy--of isochronous
      barring to Old English verse erroneously, since, historically speaking, music was not notated
      in equal measures until the twelfth century, whereas even in the Anglo-Saxon age there existed
      a tradition of unequal- measure notation for the Gregorian Chant. Luecke's purpose is to
      demonstrate the similarity of the Chant rhythms (mixed binary and ternary measures) to the
      rhythm (not meter, she insists) of Beowulf. In her system the verse (half-line) consists of
      four members, each of which is constituted minimally by a syllable but which may be
      constituted maximally by a syllable flanked by two "word- boundary pulses," producing a
      fully-expanded abstract pattern of twelve pulses (a pattern not found in Beowulf). "Member" =
      "measure." The two phrasal stresses may fall on any of the four members to produce six
      possible patterns of stressing. Cf. Silver-Beck (J289). </note>

      on-verse inclines toward the beginning, while that in the off-verse toward the end) and an
      idea of "counterbalancing" or overweighting (only a limited number of syllables may follow the

     <note> Luick had been inclined originally to accept Sievers' first published view, which was
      that the hypermetric verses were formed by affixing anacrusis to the head of an
      otherwise-normal verse, but the fact that one of the primary stresses in the anacrusis
      participated in the alliteration made the anacrusis-theory very unlikely, so Luick proposes
      here an alternate view (accepted by Sievers in 1893) that these verse are formed by a medial
      fusion of two verses, an imper- fect first one to a regular second. Out of all the possible
      permutations of the Types only eleven will actually work, five being Sievers' Five and the
      other six variations. There seems to be some difficulty with the B-forms, and Luick thinks
      perhaps they should be eliminated. His account is generally very close and ingenious, and it
      is entirely organic and autonomous: he wishes to account for the origin of these verses
      entirely on the basis of phonetic law; authorial purpose never enters the discussion at all.

     <note> Application of the transformational apparatus to the problem of assigning stress to the
      alliterants in the half-lines of Old English verse produces the conclusion that "most of the
      alliterative patterns of Beowulf are correctly predicted if we allow the COMPOUND [NOUN] RULE
      to cycle on the nodes NP, VP, and S after all transformations affecting word order internal to
      the NP and S, with the exceptions of verb-movement transformation(s)." I.e., in broader terms,
      OE meter cannot be accounted for by any theory which assigns stress to alliterants on the
      basis of grammatical category (word stress); grammatical con- nection, or syntax (sentential
      stress), is the proper approach. Maling rewrites Rieger's (J253) alliteration rule in the
      newer terminology: "in any half-line, a word bearing 1 stress must alliterate; in initial
      half-lines, a word bearing 2 stress may also alliterate, and will do so approximately 70% of
      the time. Words bearing less than 2 stress never alliterate. </note>

      Diss., Leipzig, 1907</bibl>
     <note> ; rpt in PBB 33 (1908): 95–181. Sievers regarded crossed alliteration as a result of
      higher pitch on stressed sylla- bles: "stresses with a high pitch can alliterate; others
      cannot"; sentence-accent alone would not suffice. Morgan, Sievers' pupil, takes up this
      theory, distin- guishing three grades of pitch-height: (1) the alliterating syllables bear
      "leading tones," which need not be the highest pitches in the line; these are "isotonic"; (2)
      then there are "near tones," as well as (3) "remote (far) tones," which ap- pear in two
      subtypes, overtones and undertones. The remote tones a listener will perceive as contrastive
      to the lead tones. There are also "deflected tones" which are separated from the lead tone by
      some lesser but recognizable dis- tance. (All these positions are relative not absolute.)
      Therefore: (1) stresses with lead tones must alliterate; (2) those with near tones may
      alliterate; and (3) those with far tones never alliterate with syllables of a different pitch.
      Alliteration, then, binds both by connection and by contrast. Why for example do Types B and C
      have so much less double alliteration? The second stress has a deflected tone. Symbols for
      pitches are given on p. 101. </note>

     <note> Based on his dissertation at Harvard in 1957. Adopting the treatment of hy- permetrical
      lines given by Pope (J241), Nicholson is able to show that in for- mulaic terms, such verses
      may be constructed by adding additional material to the base formula at the beginning (first

      between an off-verse and the following on-verse by enjambment (a novel suggestion). The

     <note> ; rpt in revised form as chapter 6 of his The Structure and Texture of "Beowulf" (J224).
      Statistics on the frequency and distribution of consonant- and vowel- alliteration strongly
      support the theory of single authorship. Nist distinguishes between single and shared
      alliteration and tallies the frequencies for all the con- sonants in either case: for single,
      the most frequent occurrences are h, s, and w (in descending order), for shared, s is the
      most-commonly used sound. The most-avoided consonant in both cases is p. Nist also notices
      that transverse vo- calic alliteration seems to correlate highly with nasalization.
      Conclusion: gravity rather than acuity is the distinctive feature most essential to Old
      English allit- eration. </note>

     <note> Based on his dissertation at Indiana in 1953. Nist's position on OE meter rep- resents
      an enthusiastic approval of that of W. E. Leonard (J166), combined with the scansion of
      Stewart (E333)--i.e., he accepts the four-beat, rhythmical theory, yet he is disinclined to
      follow Pope, preferring instead to work out the idea that OE verse is dipodic. The half-line
      contains two isochronous measures, which, if unequal, may be restored to balance by
      "compensation." Sixteen ba- sic measure-types or "cadences" are possible. Metrical rests or
      pauses are speci- fied as "Harpbeats"; these may fill pauses, replace missing secondary
      stresses, or separate contiguous primary stresses. The effect of these Harpbeats is to
      heighten the emotional level of a passage; the wider effect of the verseform as a whole is
      "overstressing," or promotion of every degree of natural speech stress one degree higher.
      Hypermetric lines Nist redefines as normal lines by grading down primary stresses to
      secondaries, thus effectually defining the problem out of existence, at least verbally.

      Forms in Old English Poetry. New Haven: Yale University Press, Rev. ed., 1966.</bibl>
     <note> Rev: by Roger Fowler in Anglia 87 (1969): 444–49. The most substantial treatise on Old
      English versification published in this century, and the chief rival to Sievers. Pope accepts
      the typology of stress- patterns demonstrated by Sievers, the Five Types, as legitimate, but
      takes an opposing position, maintaining that these abstract patterns tell us nothing valu-
      able about the actual recitation or delivery of the line; that is, Rhythm is more crucial than
      Meter. (But as counter to the antagonism shown in the text, note Pope's free admission of his
      indebtedness to and admiration for Sievers in the preface to the 2nd ed.) In emphasizing
      Rhythm, Pope is following Heusler (L387)--who viewed the verse (half-line) as comprised of two
      compound measures, each having four members or positions--as opposed to Kaluza (J139)--who
      viewed the verse as set in four duple measures. But Pope elabo- rates his system much further
      than Heusler did, using musical notation to de- note the rhythm rather than Heusler's symbols,
      disagreeing about the tempo of delivery (he prefers a 4/8 signature to Heusler's 4/4), and
      adding the crucial feature of initial rests in the measures, a feature not found in Heusler.
      (Pope found it in Kaluza, although there it was not established as fundamental to the metrical
      scheme, as it is in his own system.) It is these initial rests that Pope employs to account
      for Sievers' troublesome Types B and C verses, thus so- lidifying the whole structure of
      musical scansion. Then, late in the book, after the feature has been supported at length on
      purely theoretical grounds, Pope introduces as external evidence the use of the harp as
      accompaniment to reci- tation, on the grounds that an initial pause at the beginning of the
      line pre- ceding the first stress cannot be heard by an audience unless a harp-note is sounded
      to denote it. The whole argument is shrewdly deployed. The rhythmical pattern in Pope, then,
      is a verse of two compound quadruple measures, preceded by an indeterminate anacrusis, with
      stresses al- ternating within the measures, and each member representing the time re- quired
      for one grammatically short syllable, or one eighth-note in 4/8 time. Schematically: . . . | /
      x \ x | | / x \ x |. The difficulty with Pope's system, however, is its extension. In order to
      account for every variety of rhythmic actualization, and as a result of his evi- dent
      obsession for total inclusiveness and formality in the theory, Pope is forced away from a few
      simple, conceptually elegant patterns to a very de- tailed, complicated, and cumbrous
      descriptive typology of over 286 rhythmic subtypes for the a-verse alone (the number of
      varieties for each of Sievers' Five Types is: A, 107; B, 58; C, 39; D, 58; E, 17; with 7 more
      undetermined or corrupt). As Bliss put it, "a classification which is too detailed ceases to
      be a classification and becomes a description." And though Pope dismisses all these subtypes
      as not crucially important, he devotes one-half of his very large book to an exhaustive
      catalogue and statistical analysis of them. Worse still is the criticism levelled by other
      scholars that Pope's fundamental assumption of iso- chronous measures for OE verse is both
      historically and theoretically a total misapplication of the musical analogy to metrics (Pope
      does confess his ap- proval of Lanier), since isochronous barring only appeared in the West as
      a convention for notating music in the thirteenth century and was totally un- known to the
      Anglo-Saxons. There are critiques by Past (J231), Cable (J42), Fowler (J86), Silver-Beck (J288
      and J289), and Luecke (J178). Creed (J61) has produced a valuable simplification of Pope's
      system. </note>

     <note> Studies of the metrical requirements of the OE alliterative system and of com- position
      by traditional formulae should avoid being unduly narrow or else they blind us to the crucial
      fact that "the whole metrical tradition [had] established a tradition of lexical connexion"
      beyond the merely formulaic. That is, the allit- eration, through contiguity, "marked" or
      "endorsed" an expectation of lexical and syntactic complementarity--i.e. collocation--as well.
      The range of conno- tative subtlety and power established by alliterative collocations was
      enormous, and the study of their functions and effects must be entirely synthetic, keeping
      metrical, lexical, and rhetorical strategies simultaneously in view. Identification of
      verse-types, figures, or formulae is a mere preliminary. An influential study; see Lewis

      ignores an entire gamut of popular songs, chants, spells, and rhymes in the OE period not in

      of thing monks thought worthy of preservation, but they unquestionably existed, as did an
      entire tradition of classical and medieval Latin accentual rhymed verse behind them. Indeed
      rhythmus had come to denote rime as early as the eighth century. See response by Routh (J258).

     <note> The Swedish original, Angelsaksisk Sproglaere, appeared in Copenhagen in 1817. Though
      Professor Rask's conception of the alliterative structure of OE meter is substantially the
      correct one, his perspective seems odd to us now since he can view Old English only within the
      framework of the older Northern ver- seforms, especially Icelandic (Skaldic). Thus he
      categorizes the OE poetic genres in forms of the Icelandic ones, namely Narrative Verse,
      Heroic Verse, and Popular Verse, the latter two being comparatively absent in OE. In the
      Narrative (i.e. Alliterative) Verse Rask recognizes the structural function of the
      alliteration as well as the ornamentation of occasional internal- and end- rhymes, and he
      censures Hickes for not recognizing accent as the basis of the meter. "The characteristics of
      this species of verse are a) the alliteration . . . and b) the number of emphatic syllables.
      The length of each line of Narrative Verse is not so accurately determined as in Latin, by
      feet. All that here has in- fluence upon the measure seems, as in Icelandic, to be the long or
      accented syllables, which have an emphasis in the context, of which there are two in a line,
      each of which is usually followed by one, two, or even more, syllables . . . but these long
      and short syllables do not seem to be arranged according to other rules than those prescribed
      by the ear, and the cadence of the verse. . . ." Notice too Rask's insistence on setting the
      half-lines of OE verse separately rather than as long-lines. </note>

      are neither arbitrary nor eru- dite metrical forms; they are "a simple, rudimentary,
      instinctive, and even primitive form of musical, or at least rhythmical, expression." Old
      English verse preserves the syntax of prose and "a singing type of meter." That is, the verse
      was sung to music. The standard metrical form of the verse (half-line) was x / x / x, and if
      the x's are replaced by one and two syllables, the permu- tations will be discovered to be
      nothing other than the Five Types. And the rule that each verse must have at least two
      unstressed syllables will prevent va- rieties other than the Five Types from appearing. This
      is the direction taken by Pope (J241). </note>

      suggest that the rhythm of the standard line, normal and hypermetric indiscriminately, is
      tum-ti-ti + ti-tum-ti > tum-ti | tum-ti tum-ti; such verse he calls "curiously non-metrical,
      or hardly more than half-metrical." All the verse after 1200, including the revived (?)
      alliterative form, Saintsbury sees as falling under the hegemony of syllable-counting, the
      Romance con- straint which altered English verse irrevocably. But to believe this within his
      larger views he is forced to claim that the one constraint the native tradition never
      relinquished was trisyllabic substitution. Better Theory Than Facts, the Scotchman thinks.

      There is a biographical essay with photograph of Sievers by Karl Breul in Modern Quarterly of
      Language and Literature (later MLQ), vol. 1, no. 3 (1898): 173–75; another photograph appears
      as the frontispiece to PBB 57 (1933); and yet another will be found in PBB 79 (1957): 321. The
      work of Eduard Sievers rises out of the great mass of nineteenth- century German philology as
      a model of scholarship, in industry, in method, in conceptual elegance, in results. Setting
      out to find some simple, discernible, metrical pattern amid the welter of verses in the
      Beowulf, his catalogue of stress-patterns yielded up not one base meter but rather a small
      typology of five simple types of verses (half-lines). These are: A / X | / X B X / | X / C X /
      | \ X D1 / | / \ X D2 / | / X \ E / \ X | / . Each Type covers a range of subtypes which are
      extended in various ways though still recognizably of the type. Sievers' work came to be
      called the Five Types theory, then, but it is important to recognize that what he pro- duced
      is not a theory at all--it is not an explanation, but simply a description of what occurs (and
      does not occur), a typology, an empirical catalogue. Only re- cently have scholars begun to
      tackle the more formidable problem of explain- ing what Sievers showed beyond question was
      there. After Sievers' results were published in 1885, his Types were quickly verified, and it
      is a measure of the incisiveness of Sievers' analysis that every subsequent theorist of OE
      meter has been compelled to frame his thesis at least partly in terms of the Five Types. No
      matter what aspect of OE verse may be the subject of inquiry--timing, pitch patterns, syntax,
      performance--the account of stressing accepted is likely to be Sievers' (there are voices from
      the wilderness; see J2, J64, and J67). Siev- ers himself scanned OE verse with two stresses to
      the half-line, and the op- posing view, the vierhebungstheorie, was dealt crippling blows both
      by the suc- cess of Sievers' account and by the intransigent improbability of Trautmann's
      theory; consequently, subsequent four-stress theorists such as Kaluza (J139) were forced to
      attempt compromises of various sorts. On the hypermetric verses, Sievers' views shifted. In
      1887 he considered that such verses were formed generally by the prefixing of an "anacrusis"
      of / x (x) or sometimes x / (x) to an otherwise-normal verse. But in 1893, based on arguments
      made by Luick in the interim, he changed his mind, adopting the view that they were formed by
      the overlap and merger of two verses with a common interval portion; schematically,
      ----------------------|-------| + |-------|----------------------- =
      ----------------------|-------| ----------------------- For a critique of this theory see Pope
      (J242, pp. 105–15). On vowel al- literation Sievers accepted the "glottal catch" theory.

     <note> Late work: Sievers recants his earlier adherence to the "dogma" that stress is welded to
      alliteration and promotes his new theory of "Schallanalyse" (there is no adequate translation;
      "pitch-idiolect analysis" seems awkward), whereby personal intonation curves can be recovered
      from texts. This was much criti- cized (see Ipsen and Karg [L403] and Nowack [L523]), but
      Scripture approved of it and Berry's work (C35) is a clear echo. Sievers insists on
      "continuous beat" as essential to verse, procured by "hovering stress," on normalization of
      texts into their original dialects, and on three-stress OE lines in 2/4-time. </note>

      leading him to scan it by feet; this explains the statement that the Tonic foot is the basis
      of OE verse while the Dominant is the basis of the ME (alliterative) poems. Skeat lists all
      the ME alliterative MSS known to him and concludes with remarks on OE prose rhythms. </note>

     <note> The seemingly free changes of rhythm in the alliterative long line which Siev- ers
      noticed have not been explained. Cremer's explanation has so far been the best, but he could
      only hold that the poet preferred joining half-lines of differ- ent Types simply for the sake
      of variety. But in fact many lines appear with both verse-types identical. Kauffman's notion
      of a "balancing" system is not much better. It is true that any type verse can be matched with
      any other, and true also that the type chosen for the off-verse does not seem to control that
      for the on-verse. But we can perceive certain evident preferential groupings of types, as B
      with C in Beowulf. Sokoll offers five categories: (1) both verses be- gin withprepositions;
      (2) both are mainly verb phrases; (3) both begin with co- ordinating conjunctions; (4) or with
      attributive pronouns; or (5) both are sen- tences or main or subordinate clauses. </note>

     <note> Mainly a compilation of all the lines, with their syntactic position identified by
      symbols; not much can be gleaned for certain beyond the previously-known generalization that
      the A3 lines (which almost invariably occur in the first half- line) seem to announce or
      introduce a particularly important line soon to fol- low. Editorial punctuation offers little
      help. Stanley also tries to show that "transverse alliteration" is accidental rather than
      intentional. </note>

     <note> Rev: in Linguistics 62 (1971): 110–17; in English Studies 52 (1971): 157–59. Stevick
      presents here his formal argument that the spacing between morpho- logical units in the MS of
      Beowulf was very precisely regulated by the scribes so as to indicate timing features,
      specifically the internal open and terminal junc- tures, which Stevick terms the "phonological
      phrasing." The scribes gave scant attention to word-boundaries, and the occasional accent
      marks in the MSS seem to have only a very limited function, so the speech-rhythm could only be
      dented by spacing. Stevick believes that the intervals between stresses in Beowulf were
      isochronic, so that identification of junctures and hence recovery of the suprasegmental
      phonemes of the text may be used, as Joynes has shown (J138), to determine the metrical
      stressing. </note>

      with in a metrical analysis, yet long and short syllables cannot be considered temporally
      equal (i.e. isochronism does not obtain); hence, the verse should be scanned in unequal
      measures having relative proportions of 1, 1.5, 2, and 2.5 in duration. </note>

     <note> Trautmann's work on Old English versification (cited here in chronological order) was
      both preceded and followed by a number of articles on Middle English versification, especially
      on Layamon (see K404), not to speak of the many other articles he produced on philology and
      phonetics. His students (in Old English: Kuhnke, Einenkel, Menthel, and Schmitz) also
      published several long articles applying Trautmann's theories to the whole corpus of Old Ger-
      manic, Old English and Middle English verse. But all of their work is deriva- tive so I treat
      the entire body of it together here as being almost literally a sin- gle-minded effort.
      Trautmann's work is significant not in terms of its accuracy or its legitimacy but in terms of
      its sheer bulk. His own publications and the publications of his students are quite extensive,
      and though his theory has not been followed by later scholars--indeed it is hardly ever cited
      at all anymore-- still Trautmann was the last and probably the most vigorous proponent of the
      old vierhebungstheorie in Germany (the theory which Kaluza described as "the-
      good-old-much-despised-and-often-pronounced-dead-but-on-this-account-
      only-so-much-the-more-tenaciously-clinging-to-life-Lachmannian-four- accent-theory"), and for
      that reason merits notice. But even in Germany the theory was not widely accepted, and in fact
      after it had been rejected by both Sievers and Schipper in the '80s, Trautmann was responsible
      for palpitating the corpse of the system for several decades thereafter so as to make it give
      feeble signs of life. In Trautmann's view, Old and Middle English verse consisted not of one
      long line divided into two hemistichs but of a couplet of two short lines (verses), an
      extension of the (rhyming) short-couplet form first introduced into Germany by Otfrid in the
      ninth century. And, in contrast to Sievers, he con- sidered the Germanic line to be sung verse
      not recited verse (sprechvers). More specifically, he scanned each short line or verse as
      having four bars (takte) and strict measurement of time (Zeitmass), each takt being composed
      of two parts, a lift and a dip, each of which was equivalent to one short syllable, two short
      equaling one long, the whole system producing sixteen types of verses (as op- posed to
      Kaluza's ninety), eight of them in disyllabic and eight in monosyllabic bars. Within these
      sixteen there were twelve "seemingly three-bar" types (Trautmann thought they had been two-bar
      types in an older stage of the lan- guage) of four disyllabic and eight monosyllabic bars.
      This Viertakte or four-bar theory Trautmann applied rigorously to Old English verse, but when
      it came to Middle English verse he recognized that the second half-line or off-verse was
      weaker and adjusted his theory from an eight-bar to a seven-bar. The dif- ficulty with the
      whole theory is that it requires a considerable distortion of the linguistic material to find
      four beats or four bars in one half-line of Old English verse when frequently there are only
      four syllables in that verse. Further, Trautmann insisted, against all the other four-stress
      theorists, that all four stresses were equal. The traditional four-stress view had argued for
      only two primary stresses, accompanied by two secondary stresses, and even some of Trautmann's
      own students quailed before the extremity of his position on this matter. Following the
      publication of Einenkel's and Menthel's papers in 1884 and 1885, Schipper made an effort to
      combat Trautmann's views in print in 1886 (see J263). Schipper's position in support of two
      stresses per half-line has been the one borne out by history. </note>

     <note> The meaning of "formulaic" as applied to the composition of verse may be sharpened
      considerably if we recognize it as a twofold process, entailing first the translation of

      redundant words to meet the alliterative requirements of the meter. That is, [this is
      striking] what is "formulaic" about a phrase is not the fixity of its essential idea or head
      noun but the actual variation of its exte- rior members. These appendages do not detract from
      the sense of the kernel, but they do not add to it either, and it is they who perform the

     <note> Scholarly interest in the structural and ornamental properties of alliteration--so
      obvious a feature--has obscured the role--even the degree--of assonance and its effects in
      Middle English verse, but as Adams shows, Chaucer's use of the latter device is if anything
      even more pervasive than the less subtle alliteration. He may have learned it from either the
      French or the Italian traditions, where it is common due to inflection, but it also appears
      more frequently than we think in the native OE and ME tradition, often as a result of
      rhetorical figuration. See the author's larger study (C127), but see also the criticism by

      60–62; in Arizona Quarterly 19 (1964): 271–74. Baum's handbook of Chaucerian versification is
      designed both to entertain and to instruct, by illustrating various aspects of Chaucer's
      verse-technique. Conse- quently it is not a treatise or a theory of Chaucerian meter; it is a
      reassertion of the traditional views. Baum draws his conclusions from limited samples and
      generally prefers to treat all questions as matters of taste, not wishing to inquire into any
      one question so far as to take a decided position. He sees Chaucer's line as both syllabic and
      accentual, ultimately "a series of five iambs." Chapter 1 treats the technicalities of
      versification: metrical variation (weak stresses, spondees, substitution, use of final -e, and
      elision), the iambic tetrameter (oc- tosyllabic) couplets (they show greater irregularity
      because they are founded on both native and foreign models, the native accentual influence
      being strong), rhyme (Chaucer decidedly prefers feminines, and certain specific rhyme-pairs as
      well) and stanza (his favorite was the royal, of course, which may have been the source for
      the couplet if it did not come from lengthening the short cou- plets). Chapter 2 treats sound
      texture and further metrical variation (irregular lines, enjambement, pauses, and variant
      weighting of consecutive lines); chap- ter 3 illustrates the "embellishments," the "purple
      inlays" in the verse. An Ap- pendix criticizes Southworth's theory (K367). </note>

     <note> The older view that ME Alliterative Revival verse must have sprung from a (hypothesized)
      continuous tradition of OE popular poetry (now entirely lost) is really not very tenable; a
      much more probable explanation (heretofore ig- nored) results from our recollection of the
      very close "interanimation" of prose and verse in ME. There "the boundary between verse and
      prose was so blurred that a clear division is impossible," and this intermediary, mixed form
      may be termed rhythmical alliteration; it was a verbal mode which could be al- ternately lined
      or unlined without concern. Moreover, it was the OE prose texts, preserved by the clergy and
      less vulnerable to change in the language than more strictly ordered verbal structures, which
      were recopied throughout the twelfth century, not the high OE poetry. The Brut shows a later
      develop- ment of this hybrid mode. </note>

      interest. After an examination of the stressing of OF loan-words in ME and the question of the
      sounding of inflectional -e, Borroff makes a preliminary metrical analysis (for purposes of
      comparison) of the meter of Cursor Mundi, finding it accentual- syllabic (in fact, a plain
      iambic tetrameter with inversions, etc.), the syllable- counting deriving from French and the
      accent-alternation from Medieval Latin. About a dozen unambiguous examples show that the final
      -e in rhyme was not pronounced. She then reviews (valuably, in detail) the dispute be- tween
      the four-beat and the seven-beat theories of the ME long-line meter; following Leonard (K215)
      and Stewart (K379), Borroff tries to negotiate a middle course between them by scanning the
      stresses as dipodic (her term is "compound"), but in the end she settles on the four-beat
      view, allowing five in "extended" lines, which are treated in the final chapter. The analysis
      as a whole is based on Thomson [one had hoped he had been forgotten, but no], Elder Olson
      (B158), and Kokeritz; it is, both in its conception and its method- ology, an exceedingly
      conservative approach. </note>

     <note> in Anglia Beiblatt 33 (1922): 120. A monument of Chaucer scholarship, surpassed up to
      its time perhaps only by Tyrwhitt in the eighteenth century: Ten Brink's formulations and
      synthesis of the German work before him became the foundation for all the work on Chaucer's
      prosody after the turn of the twentieth century. To be sure, some of his principles are now (a
      century later) outdated, but the edifice remains ad- mirable in form even if it is seldom
      used. The edifice contains three chambers: Phonology, Accidence, and Verse and Stanza
      Structure, each carefully delim- ited, divided, organized, and ordered. In Chaucer's metric,
      Ten Brink distin- guishes the natural stresses from the metrical rhythm, and further, three
      possi- ble results when these two systems conflict: "either the accent must yield to the
      exigencies of the verse--accent shift; or the rhythm must conform to the normal
      accentuation--inversion of the metrical measure; or finally, in delivery a compromise must be
      attempted of such a character that the hearer remains conscious both of the natural
      accentuation and of the claims of the rhythm-- level stress--veiled rhythm" [italics added].
      The "level stress" is a compromise scansion. How modern all this sounds! The cracks in the
      edifice arise from a ground-fault: Ten Brink takes the Chaucerian line as an iambic
      decasyllable more than pentameter, and so whenever a line fails to be ten-syllabled, he
      immediately emends. We know better than that now. But his text is the irreproachable Chaucer
      Society Six- Text Edition, his terms are very clear, and his command of detail is sure.

     <note> A companion-piece to Medary (K252). The devices of stanza-linking and be- ginning and
      ending a poem with the same word cannot have originated under the influence of Romance or
      Medieval Latin, as has been suggested, since no body of sources can be found. The devices are
      very common in Irish and Welsh, however, which must surely be the sources. Brown notes that
      the in- fluence of Irish and Welsh prosodic conventions on the Alliterative Revival in the
      North of Britain has been entirely unexplored. But cf. Travis (L264, L266). </note>

     <bibl> Conner, Jack. English Prosody From Chaucer to Wyatt. The Hague: Mouton, 1974. 98 pp. +
      Bibliography and Index.</bibl>
     <note> Both Saintsbury and Wimsatt would have admired this book: with grace, lu- cidity,
      candor, and rigor, Conner sets forth his argument that "a single tradi- tion of prosodic
      theory extends all the way from Chaucer to the Elizabethans . . . all used the same metrical
      pattern . . . that of iambic feet in four-foot or five-foot lines." In short, Chaucer
      invented, and wrote, the iambic pentameter (not necessarily the iambic decasyllable). As
      support, Conner offers a hypothesis in medieval phonology: every consonant which ended a word
      had an obligatory release (schwa), a feature which disappeared from the language between 1500
      and 1550. Thus, Conner directs metrical attention away from inconsistent scribal texts (and
      the vexations of the final -e) and toward the pronunciation of the words in the lines. His
      scansions thereby become considerably more com- plex, but the lines can still be shown to be
      iambic. The advantage of the the- ory is that the entire medieval metrical tradition from
      Chaucer to Shakespeare may be seen as coherent and continuous. In metrical studies, work of
      this sort- -a graceful presentation where the author is completely candid about his ar-
      gument, its assumptions, the evidence, and the consequences--is very, very rare. (But for a
      contrary appraisal see K136). </note>

     <note> Chaucer's seven-line stanza rhyming ababbcc is less often tripartite (two pedes and a
      cauda), as Ten Brink thought, than bipartite; the form is bipartite--abab, bcc--about 40% of
      the time it is used, and Cowling terms this type the 4:3 type. Other less frequent versions
      are the 3:4 (aba, bbcc--over 20%), the 5:2 (ababb, cc--less than 20%), and a rare 2:5 (ab,
      abbcc). The shift from usage of the 4:3 type to the 3:4 type also provides a very rough
      metrical test for dating some of the poetry. All of the types show an internal syntactic or
      semantic pause, the volta. Cf. Lineberger (K220). </note>

     <note> "Contemporaneously with the Norman Conquest, English lyric poetry aban- doned its
      traditional prosody, the essence of which was a fusion of natural Germanic accent and metre
      with alliteration in continuous, loose, unrhymed long-lines, and adopted quite a different
      rhythm in which stress alternated regularly with unstress and the lines were shorter, rimed,
      and commonly or- ganized into stanzas." The source of the new form of ME lyrics was almost ex-
      clusively the Latin hymn meters, not the Provençal or Romance verse tradi- tions. But was the
      source of the form the source of the change? The author ar- gues that it was the religious
      lyric in England which preserved the native tra- dition, combined it with the Latin one, and
      transmitted this fusion to the secular lyric later in the ME period. </note>

     <note> A reply to Southworth (K366), who replies to Donaldson in "Chaucer's Final - E
      (Continued)," PMLA 64 (1949): 601–9, followed by a summary statement from both parties on pp.
      609–10. Donaldson turns aside from the question of the rhymes for the bulk of his essay in
      order to defend the account traditionally given of the final -e (it had dropped out of
      pronunciation by Chaucer's time or was well along in the process of doing so, a state of
      affairs leaving Chaucer in the virtually unique position among English poets of having an
      unusually supple language (dou- blets) to work with, and allowing him to use the -e
      selectively for metrical exi- gency), to demonstrate that Southworth's statistics are grossly
      distorted by a failure to consider elision (in fact if elision is taken into account the
      figures are nearly reversed), and to argue that Southworth's logic by a curious twist actu-
      ally confirms the traditional account. On sounding of the -e in the rhymes Donaldson argues in
      effect for consistency (if within the line then surely at the end as well) and for the
      unlikely possibility of eye-rhymes, given the aural bent of the age. </note>

     <note> A fresh examination of the MS at The Wars of Alexander not only vindicates Max Kaluza's
      theory of strophic divisions in the poem (K182) (which most other critics deny) by noting
      additional marginal marks hitherto missed but also adds further weight to the theory by
      providing a cogent motivation for the larger strophic units: they are intended to correlate
      with units in the text of the Latin source. Further, the concept of a stanzaic grouping of
      lines which nonetheless lacks any rhyme to bind it together is a technique which came into
      MEAV from Old Norse poetry, not Old English. </note>

     <note> Analysis of a thousand lines of the A-text fails to confirm the traditional view that
      the poem is metrically careless, loose, and erratic. All five of the conven- tional OE
      verse-types described by Sievers can be identified in Piers Plowman with only a minimum of
      divagation, and the alliterations correlate closely with the primary lexical stresses. Hence,
      we must conclude that the poet both un- derstood and intended to perpetuate the older
      alliterative verse-form, which shows that the tradition was continuous, not revived. </note>

     <note> The first line of the General Prologue may be the most disputed scansion in Chaucer: is
      it an acephalous iambic pentameter (with Aprill disyllabic) or a regular decasyllable with
      initial trochaic substitution (Aprille trisyllabic)? At least seven scansions are possible,
      but close scrutiny of the MSS evidence sug- gests that the traditional (Ten Brink's) view
      favoring the latter scansion is more likely than Manly's preference for the former. Indeed it

      sophistication. Fifield reviews the works of Ten Brink, Baum, Southworth, and Halle-Keyser on

      Trager-Smith and the Chomsky-Halle phonologies (considering the latter as an advance over the
      former) to the problem of Chaucerian stress. The four levels of stress possible in
      Trager-Smith will allow six possible forms of iambic feet, and, with addi- tional constraints,
      4,004 legitimate forms of iambic lines (by computer analy- sis). See the Appendix for a most
      succinct statement of those constraints. The generative phonology, however, "reveals aspects
      of prosody never before ob- jectively recognized: tessitura of stress, range of stress,
      distribution and position of stress levels, the function of word order, and the actual
      operation of metrical tension on running speech-stress." A provocative argument that
      Chaucerian meter has "still unmeasured variety within its order." </note>

      219–30.</bibl>
     <note> The surviving fragments show that Early ME accentual verse is defined by neither
      alliteration nor rhyme but by two other specific characteristics: a verse (half-line) of two
      stresses, and heavy syntactic stopping at the end of both the verse and the line. These two
      constraints were sufficiently weak that they en- couraged considerable metrical variety while
      discouraging metrical complexity, whereas the stronger constraints of the Five Types did not
      survive changes in the stress-rules of the language. In this respect meter was but one element
      among many in EME verse, which as a rule chose simplification, stereotyping, and formula
      instead of their opposites. The source of EME verseform was probably not French (this was the
      nineteenth century view), OE popular po- etry (Oakden's), or rhythmical prose (Blake's, and
      the least improbable one), but rather the classical OE line in a degenerate form (Layamon
      tells us his sources are books) and Latin, which would have suggested rhyme to the ME poet,
      even though the real impetus behind rhyming was ultimately change in the language itself. An
      outstanding study. </note>

     <note> After Sir Thopas is over, the matter may lurch somewhat but the meter is sure; we have
      been returned to the sure order and control of the couplets; the poet's in his narrative place
      and all's right with the world. Within, however, it is the meter that lurches, as Chaucer
      turns his hand to witty and ironic parody of the profession of the poet and thereby himself.
      (It is so with the doggerel poems that Shakespeare's characters proffer as good poetry in the
      plays.) Chaucer's joke is on himself, but underneath the wit there is art: when he comes to
      tell of poetry he tells it straight, so it is the way of the telling, the meter, which must
      serve his ends and belie his words, making him seem a driveler and a hack. This is the good
      art that can make bad art for play--and for purpose. </note>

     <bibl> -----. "Scanning the Prosodists: An Essay in Metacriticism." Chaucer Review 11 (1976):
      22–82.</bibl>
     <note> Not only an immensely useful article, as a full review of the major studies of Chaucer's
      versification in this century--Ten Brink, Baum, Southworth, Robinson, Knight, Fifield, Conner,
      and Halle-Keyser--but also a remarkably lucid critique of prosody theory itself: from fifteen
      exemplary passages in the "General Prologue," Gaylord extracts some questions that one would
      want to answer about them, prosodically, and also a set of broader a priori questions--
      assumptions--about Text, Pronunciation, Metrical Patterns, Versification, and Poetic
      Effect--that will have to be answered in any satisfactory theory, and that any prosodist does
      answer, implicitly if not explicitly, whenever he writes about Chaucer's versification. The
      ensuing review of the prosodic work leaves the reader glum, though, despite the reviewer's
      grace, wit, and lambent good sense, because pretty clearly the scholarship has made no advance
      in this cen- tury: no new breakthroughs have occurred, several bizarre theories have been
      proposed, the older "standard" philological works have not been corrected, and a general
      opinion has developed in scholarly circles that work on Chau- cer's verse-craft is just not
      interesting or important. Hopefully the present essay will effect some change in that
      attitude. Had it kept the same title and applied the same methodology, except to all of Eng-
      lish verse, I would have judged it one of the five most important works on versification
      written since Schipper. </note>

     <note> A comprehensive review of the "voluminous" scholarship on Chaucer's versifi- cation and
      analyses of his three most characteristic metrical forms: octosyllabic couplets, decasyllabic
      couplets, and rhyme royal. Gilbert views Chaucer's met- ric as "balancing" the foreign,
      literate, accentual-syllable tradition and the na- tive, oral, strong-stress meter, so that
      his lines fit the syllabic norms yet also tend to fall into recognizable hemistichs, resulting
      in a "highly complex" met- rical system that allows "immense variety, subtlety, and power" in
      its verses. </note>

     <note> The received opinion of this stanza-form has been that it is "uniquely unsuited for
      narrative use," despite its very wide usage. Analysis of meter, syntax, stanza-linking, and
      stylistic modification of source-material in fourteen ro- mances, however, shows that the
      stanza is organized metrically into three- and four-line phrases dominated by hypotactic
      constructions, that the tail-line is used for rhetorical not narrative purposes, and that
      narrative continuity is es- tablished by means other than direct stanza-linking. The stanza
      thus seems best adapted to amplification of theme, even though it does not actually inhibit
      de- velopment of the narrative. </note>

     <note> Originally intended only as a prolegomenon to a study of the early English lyric, this

      examination of the Provençal and Romance verse traditions, suggest that the Latin tradition
      was the foremost in- fluence on the English, especially in terms of the adoption of the
      Goliard stanza and the polyphonic musical form. Provençal forms seem to have been relatively
      alien to the English. </note>

      Chaucer's versification, where Horne defends Chaucer's virtuosity with great vigor, by siding
      with Tyrwhitt against all those who hold that any line not exactly decasyllabic is lame or
      inept and on these grounds prove Chaucer to be an awkward versifier, since he has many longer
      and shorter lines. Horne's informal survey of the history of English versification shows ex-
      actly the same case to hold for all the greatest poets, and a further argument compressing
      lines with extra syllables into the same time-periods as the normal verses completes his
      defense. </note>

     <note> This is Kaluza's original argument that ME alliterative poems are, based on regular
      marginal marks in the MSS, divided into quatrains and then grouped into larger strophic units
      of multiples of quatrains, i.e. (title of poem followed by number of lines to the strophe):
      The Wars of Alexander, 24; Crouned King, 16; St. Erkenwald, 32; Chevelere Assigne, 8; The
      Siege of Jerusalem, 36; Sir Gawain and Patience, 12; Pearl and Purity, 60 (quintuple groupings
      of these triple- quatrain units); and the Morte Arthure, among others, 8 or 12. Kaluza's
      theory has not been generally accepted--see Day (K84) and Vantuono (K416)--but recently it has
      been defended vigorously by Duggan (K93). Cf. Hans Möller on OE poetry (J211) and Hulbert

      phrase, exactly coterminous with the half- line, two phrases being formally balanced to make
      the line--is paralleled strik- ingly in modern free verse: no metrical modulation or tension
      is possible in this meter; there is no norm to play against, as in syllable-counting meter.

     <bibl> Lawton, David A. "Gaytryge's Sermon, Dictamen, and Middle English Alliterative Verse."
      MP 76 (1978–79): 329–43.</bibl>
     <note> An obscure by-way leads to a major reassessment of perspective. An instruc- tion to his
      diocese written by the Archbishop of York in 1357, as found in an authorized translation of
      this sermon by John Gaytryge, provoked a quarrel between Skeat and others in the late
      nineteenth century as to whether the piece was in prose or verse. Skeat thought that unrhymed
      MEAV influenced the form of the sermon, but in fact it was ME rhythmical prose, and behind
      that the medieval cursus of the ars rithmica. The sermon itself was very influen- tial and may
      actually have influenced MEAV. Its form is--not verse, but not prose--lineated near-verse,
      rhythmical, spasmodically rhymed and alliterated, in four-stress lines, but extremely
      irregular in all of these. When we reflect that over half of the extant corpus of unrhymed
      MEAV represents translations of Latin texts, we begin to see the origin of the MEAV long-line
      as a conscious effort to parallel, in the vernacular, the Latin ars dictaminis. </note>

     <note> An extension of his earlier argument in favor of the vierhebung scansion of the OE verse
      (J166) to ME, though like the others of that persuasion Leonard considers that the eight-beat
      long-line in OE was reduced to seven in the ME, the second verse being looser. But he prefers
      to make his case (in the Tale of Gamelyn) without reference to OE, as if it had not existed.
      Cunningly, he shows that the seven-beat line of Gamelyn is in fact indistinguishable from the
      "four-beat" line of Piers Plowman by mixing extracts from both and asking the reader if he can
      tell which is which. Leonard has a feisty temperament and also--rarity of rarities in this
      field--a wonderfully lively style, full of vigor, wit, directness of speech, and homely
      examples. </note>

     <note> ; rpt. in his Selected Literary Essays. Ed. Walter Hooper. Cambridge: Cambridge
      University Press, 1969. pp. 45–57. We think the fifteenth-century line bad only because we try
      to read it as a decasyllable, an iambic pentameter, which Lewis believes it is not. In fact,
      he argues, it is plainly the familiar, old, popular ballad meter: "a long line divided by a
      sharp medial break into two half-lines, each containing not less than two nor more than three
      stresses, and most hovering between two and three stresses." This meter can be found in
      Chaucer even though many of his lines are certainly pentameters. Whence came the pentameter
      form? Not from the French--their line counts syllables but knows nothing of the principle of
      stress- alternation. We must conclude then that Chaucer "attempted a compromise"; he intended
      to write five-stress decasyllables, but the older tune "was running in his head and he allowed
      it to intrude; he even welcomed it." Such a combi- nation or conflation was possible precisely
      because [this is the crux] "the one metre slips easily into the other." And still slips,
      today, not only in nursery rhymes and popular songs but in serious verse. What Chaucer
      received as a native verse tradition (from early ME), and what the post-Chaucerians re- verted
      to so quickly, was a hemistich of simply "two, or two-and-a-half, or three" stresses. That is
      the most one can say of the meter. </note>

     <note> An omnibus survey of ME verse, both (1) rhymed-alliterative (as in Layamon and King
      Horn) and (2) fully (Revival) alliterative, based on the work Luick had earlier published in
      Anglia. On the verse of the Alliterative Revival Luick is generally sound, but his position on
      the nature of the unusual fully-rhymed- but-occasionally-alliterative verseform in the Brut
      and King Horn, however, is unsound: Luick adopted the theory that the verse of Layamon and the
      Horn was not derived from the OE alliterative long-line ("stress-verse") but was a separate
      form which appeared only in ME, as an analogue to Otfrid's rhymed verse in Germany, and
      contained four beats (takte, "beat-verse") to the verse (half-line)--i.e., according to the
      old vierhebungstheorie (cf. Trautmann). Thus, Luick believed that ME verse showed three
      distinct and wholly detached tradi- tions--the revival of the older native alliterative
      long-line, the Otfridian four- beat rhymed short line, and the Romance syllable-counting
      "foot-verse." Op- posed to this view stand Schipper (A9), who sees the Layamon-Horn verse as
      simply a loosened form directly descended from the OE verse tradition, and West (K430).

      demonstrate a clear pattern of regularity in the seemingly irregular distribution of final
      -e's on monosyllabic nouns in Chaucer's English, yielding the conclusion that his speech was
      neither archaic nor overly "poeti- cal" but a judicious middle course within contemporaneous
      East Midlands us- age. The -e had been regularly affixed to OE feminine nouns by analogy be-
      fore Chaucer's time, and it was still being used after final double consonants (and long
      vowels) to distinguish them from single. Employing a metrical "arsis- test," McJimsey shows
      that monosyllables ending in -e never stand in the first position of an iamb. </note>

      Baltimore: J. H. Furst, 1904. 36 pp.</bibl>
     <note> Layamon's verse presents to us the remarkable spectacle of an attempt to com- bine two
      major--and inconsistent--verse-traditions. The Brut shows both allit- eration and rhyme. But
      the use of rhyme increases over the course of the poem while that of alliteration decreases,
      and in general the usage of allitera- tion here is not sufficient to justify classifying the
      poem as alliterative rather than rhymed (84.4% of the lines have rhyme, 67.6% alliteration).
      The influ- ence of Wace is heavy both in the principle of rhyme, the new device which steadily
      supplanted Layamon's familiarity with the old alliteration, and also in meters. Layamon had
      neither the desire nor the capacity to imitate the syllabic regularity of Wace's lines, yet
      they affected him sufficiently to lengthen his ha- bitual (shorter) OE lineform whenever he
      followed his source-material most closely; the result is that Layamon would write a series of
      longer lines, then re- vert to shorter lines out of neglect or instinct, thereby confounding
      the stabil- ity and homogeneity of his verse. It was the capacity for allowing more stresses
      (and possibly iambicity) in the French line which attracted Layamon (even un- consciously) to
      it. But Layamon never could forget or outgrow the OE model that he had learned early, and so
      his focus on line-length and/or rhyme, even though it increased as the poem progressed,
      produced not a new form but a curious, mixed, hybrid type of the old form. Trautmann and his
      followers were wrong in their account of Layamon's meter--Schipper was correct to up- hold the
      zweihebungstheorie--but even Schipper's classification of the meters in the Brut is
      "redundant" in its types and "incomplete" in its categories. McNary's revised classification
      appears on pp. 24–25. This is a very solid study, with important results and an excellent
      conclusion. </note>

     <note> Though published in a somewhat obscure vehicle, this essay is in fact a very important
      contribution to metrical theory; admitting Lydgate's shortcomings as metrist, Manzalaoui
      searches for an adequate theoretical description, which leads directly to a reconsideration of
      the whole theory of meter. Taking three descriptive terms from the fine arts, Manzalaoui
      sketches out the varieties of metrical form: Function Descriptive Decorative Expressive
      Regularity Natural speech-rhythms Strict meter Perfect identity between natural rhythm and
      abstract meter Irregularity Simple incompetence at metrics Variety for variety's sake
      Semantically expressive metrical variation Then he defines the levels of requiredness
      (necessity, constraint) of metrical elements in a theoretical system: • Exigency: obligatory
      aspects such as stress (in English verse); • Contingency: secondary or non-ordered but
      unavoidable elements such as quantity or pitch patterning; • Speech-Rhythm: in its interplay
      with meter; • Secondary Exigency: elements ordered merely by convention rather than linguistic
      necessity, such as rhyme; • Special Cases of the Exigency: certain specific conventions become
      quite rigid; • Constraint Within a "Special Case": sub-constraint within specific convention;
      • Delivery: recitative, chant, and oral interpretation. Finally, Manzalaoui suggests that in
      the long, complex transition from stress-verse to syllable-counting verse and alliteration to
      rhyme, regressions and atavisms occurred: the iambic pentameter, losing the special constraint
      of its iambicness, relaxed into alliterative stress-verse (an exigency) without the special
      exigency of the alliteration itself. Within the system both major rules and minor constraints
      may have shifted or relaxed at separate times. </note>

     <note> Rev.: in TLS, 6 December 1934, p. 878; in Anglia Beiblatt 48 (1937): 13–14. Though there

      study. He demonstrates amply the hegemony of this form from about 1350 to 1500--a domination
      more complete than that of the couplet over the eighteenth century--and provides an even more
      vari- able survey of its antecedents in medieval Latin, Old French, and Old English verse.
      Conclusions: the seven-line rhyme royal is not a modification of ottava rima, it is a
      simplification of the ballade and as such is by far Chaucer's most im- portant borrowing from
      the French (he persistently avoided all Italian verse- forms). Similarly, the Spenserian
      stanza is not based on ottava or terza rima but on the rhyme royal in Chaucer. </note>

     <note> This essay should be a summary of what is now the Received Opinion on the subject.
      Following Oakden (K242) fairly closely, Moorman characterizes the OE verseform (heroic, pagan,
      tribal) and social milieu, then argues that there was a continuous preservation of the meter,
      language, and themes of classical OE poetry into the ME period (there is no example anywhere
      in art of the complete extinction and subsequent recovery of a major technique in a pe- riod).
      In the late OE period alongside the professional scops and clerics there appeared a class of
      popular minstrels, less proficient but more experimental metrically, who preserved the
      alliterative technique in an oral tradition (the sentiments of which were not acceptable to
      the copyists in the monasteries) until it reflowered in the fourteenth century. </note>

     <note> The poet used (1) the alliterating sounds to suggest, mimetically, certain lexical and
      semantic points, as with the use of gr- and bilabial stops to body forth, kinesthetically, the
      fight scenes, and (2) the grouping and repetition of alliter- ants (elsewhere termed
      "plurilinear alliteration") as a mnemonic device to "help the listener to perceive the
      grouping of details." This last is significant, has not been suggested before, I think, and
      deserves considerable attention. </note>

      formulae] IV. Style ["tags," fillers; style in general]. Though later work has modified this
      perspective in details, Oakden is still the standard authority on Middle English Alliterative
      Verse (MEAV). Note however from his title the extent of his domain: he does not treat at all
      the other two primary streams of ME verse, the tail-rhyme romances and the truly syllabic and
      stanzaic, Romance-influenced meters (most prominently Chau- cer's). But since Oakden's account
      of MEAV is a major one--on a level with Schipper's--and since it is not especially easy to
      follow, a summary (with schema) will be in order. The true OE alliterative line (meter) was
      preserved intact in the monas- teries even as late as 1150 (the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle verses,
      1065; the Descrip- tion of Durham, ca. 1100, for example). Meanwhile the popular verseform
      (showing irregular rhyme and assonance with alliteration), preserved through- out the OE
      period and probably closely related to rhythmical prose as Blake suggests, combines with the
      classical (Five Types) meter; "the long line breaks up and a couplet is formed," having rhyme
      (internal rhyme in the long-line becomes final rhyme in the half-line couplets; Oakden
      neglects to say this though he clearly assumes it) together with alliteration (e.g., the
      Worchester fragment and the Departing Soul's Address to the Body, both ca. 1170; the Proverbs
      of Alfred, 1180; Layamon, 1189–1207; and the Bestiary, ca. 1200–50). This na- tive couplet
      "inevitably becomes more and more syllabic, until it is written side by side with the French
      couplet and becomes indistinguishable from it," as witnesses the Brut, a poem in which
      alliteration is still dominant over rhyme, Layamon generally preferring not to mix the two,
      though the syllabic influ- ence of the French is everywhere evident. In the West the
      more-strictly- classical line without rhyme must have been preserved (though we have no extant
      major works) until it flowered again in the Alliterative Revival, ca. 1340–1450. (To this
      movement Oakden naturally devotes considerable atten- tion; see below.) In the Southwest,
      however, the popular verse tradition seems to have survived in another line of development;
      here the long-line adopted end-rhyme (instead of medial-rhyme followed by breaking into
      hemistichic couplets), apparently under the influence of the Latin septenary, and formed long
      couplets with some syllabic regularity. The line is not very strong but it is there, as
      witnesses On God Orison of Our Lady (ca. 1200), up until about 1300; thereafter, this form
      appears in the Northeast and Scotland, where it soon after gave way to the bob-and-wheel
      stanza, a form of extraordinary versatility and vigor, dominant from ca. 1350 to 1550. The
      hybrid short-couplet form seen in Layamon and apparently also the long end-rhymed couplets are
      eventually subsumed into a strictly syllabic couplet, under the pressure of French, which is
      the form we see in Chaucer. This way Wyatt lies. As for the disputed Alliterative Revival in
      the West, Oakden cites the evidence of (1) patterns of identical alliteration in consecutive
      lines, (2) in- stances of full-line alliteration "foreshadowed" or prefigured in earlier
      lines, and (3) the survival of Sievers' Type C as proving the direct descent of the
      fourteenth-century alliterative line from the OE. Even further proof can be gleaned by
      observing six other metrical features already evident in Early ME which continued to develop:
      heavy end-stopping; alliteration only on identical vowels as well as identical consonants;
      lengthening of the line; recognizable OE alliteration patterns; extended half-lines; and a
      general collapse of the OE verse-types into one amorphous, general, flexible type in ME. New
      character- istics of the MEAV of the Revival period include stanzas, eye alliteration, and
      excessive alliteration. In an Appendix Oakden argues for the sole authorship of Sir Gawain,
      Purity, Patience, and St. Erkenwald by the "Gawain-poet," and separate author- ship for each
      of three other poems, the Destruction of Troy, the Wars of Alexan- der, and the Morte Arthure.

      volume 2 of Oakden's study is reprinted in a student's edition as </note>

     <note> A student of Trautmann's (see K404), Pilch turns his attention to both the al-
      literative and rhymed verse of Middle English, hoping to show a steady and unified development
      throughout all of ME verse in the twelfth through four- teenth centuries. The Introduction
      reviews the history of the vierhebungstheorie and its opponent on the question of ME verseform
      succinctly and accurately; Pilch then turns to separate metrical analyses of eighteen ME
      poems, chiefly the Brut and King Horn. His view of the rhymed verse in ME (MERV) is that these
      short couplets were derived from a fusion of the Latin hymn verse with the French
      octosyllabic, producing an English meld which originally had counted only stresses (not
      syllables) but gradually came to regulate the number of slacks as well, resulting in a regular
      alternation of both. The alliterative verse, however, was a reversion of the Latin septenary
      to the unrhymed allit- erative form of OE verse; the MEAV is thus in effect an unrhymed
      septenary. </note>

     <note> An exceptionally close and careful critique of the position taken by Robinson (K318),
      most especially his conception of the "balanced pentameter," the me- ter that he believes
      Chaucer was able to create by fusing the characteristics of both the old native alliterative
      meter and the imported Romance syllabic me- ter, retaining the characteristics of both forms
      together. Pyle reinforces the tra- ditional view, that Chaucer's hybrid meter gave up certain
      characteristics of both its parent forms in order to become a distinctively new--albeit
      unstable-- form. Also discussed: trochaic substitution, spondees, pronunciation, MS evi-
      dence. </note>

     <note> At two points in his narrative where a character recites an old proverb, Chau- cer makes
      an effort to preserve its colloquial flavor (i.e., order of phrasing), so that the meter for a
      moment slips from the pentameter mode into the older four-stresses mode. </note>

     <note> Skelton's verseform seems to have been an extension of forms popular before the
      Conquest, and its two identifying characteristics--shortness of line-length and irregular
      rhyme-grouping--were probably derivatives of (respectively) the OE half-line, with its
      descendant the short rhyming couplet showing a lesser influence from Medieval Latin and French
      verse, and the (much-neglected) Anglo-Norman tradition. </note>

     <note> One can discern actual orderliness in Lydgate's metrical ineptitude by recog- nizing
      that he employs a fixed medial caesura even though the flanking hemis- tichs vary greatly; in

      line of four stresses" and strong caesura, but Skelton thought of it as two short lines in a
      rough triple rhythm. With this four-stress line alternates a more regular four-foot iambic
      tetrameter line (Ramsay terms these "heavy" and "light"); both of these together give four
      general types of line--short and long/heavy and light. Skelton keeps them pretty well distinct
      by rhyme schemes, chiefly rhyme royal, couplets, and the repeated "leash" rhyme. On the whole
      Magnyfycence [ca. 1516] shows a surprising variety of forms and a rich profusion of new forms
      which are nevertheless skillfully posi- tioned and controlled for purposes of

      to imitate Chaucer's meter. We must distinguish between his four-stress verse and his
      octosyllables (which regulate syllable count strictly). His pentameters, however, combine
      features of the octosyllable with the variable caesura of the fourteener. </note>

     <bibl> Robinson, Ian. Chaucer's Prosody: A Study of the Middle English Verse Tradition. London:

     <note> ; rpt. 1973. Rev.: by G. A. Fraser in Language and Style 5 (1972): 313–15: a very
      interesting and useful review giving examples of second- and fifth-foot reversals. Also re-
      viewed by M. Gretsch in Anglia 92 (1974): 454–60; in ELN 11 (1973): 123– 26; in English
      Studies 54 (1973): 272–74; in Cambridge Quarterly 5 (1971): 589– 93; in Speculum 49 (1974):
      148–51. Robinson's book stands somewhere between the introductory level and the scholarly; his
      principles are iconoclastic, and seem, from a certain distance, al- most silly at times. For
      example, he is very much distressed that the student will try to read Chaucer in Middle
      English, and so disparages the sound-charts of all the standard editions, claiming that we
      know nothing concrete about fourteenth-century phonology. His chapter on "Rhythm and Metre"
      gives rhythm the precedence: "in much of the best English verse the metre does not fully
      replace speech-rhythms." He agrees with Northrop Frye that Chaucer's line is not an iambic
      pentameter but a four-beat line (p. 52) and considers that the best way to understand "the
      notion of an ideal metre is to think of it in terms of expectation and call it 'a willingness
      to create the metre.'" He disdains a metrically-weighted recitation of Chaucer. Following a
      chapter on Chaucer's own prosodic terms and idea, Robinson takes up the final -e in a long
      chapter (perhaps the best) which con- cludes equivocally: "if the metre seems to demand an -e
      sound it, but if the resulting reading damages the poetry, suspect the metre that led to it."
      But, staggeringly, he rejects "variable stress" on Middle English words; this course leads to
      fifth-foot trochees in some of Chaucer's pentameters, a consequence which Robinson prefers. He
      thinks the verse best punctuated in phrasal-units, as the medieval MSS do, because he believes
      the Chaucerian line to be a "bal- anced pentameter"--i.e., a line of five feet, usually
      iambic, but also divided into half-lines, following the alliterative tradition. Two final
      chapters treat the Chaucerians from Hoccleve and Lydgate to Wyatt; an Appendix repudiates any
      efforts to trace the sources of Chaucer's metric in foreign versifications. Bibliography. The
      whole thrust and tone of this work is negative, reactionary, and eccentric: it cannot
      represent any ad- vance in either scholarship or method. See the critiques by Pyle (K302) and

     <note> The long excursus on the history of English versification (especially in late ME and the
      early Renaissance) which Schröer appends to his study of John Bale's (1495–1563) interlude A
      Comedy Concernynge Thre Laws (dialogue in couplets, monologues in ababbcc stanzas) is now
      entirely forgotten, but undeservedly so. True, Schröer does consider the ME alliterative meter
      to be an eight-beat long line, an erroneous conception which forces the reader of this essay
      to do a good deal of mental translation of terms as he goes, but nevertheless the range of
      Schröer's excursus makes it required reading for anyone who would attempt to write the
      long-overdue History of Middle English Meters. He discusses the confusion and experimentation
      resulting from the contact of the old native line with the Latin septenary and Romance
      Alexandrine which produced fourteeners, imperfect tetrameters, and other forms, depending on
      whether a given poet counted syllables or not. Bale himself is the perfect exemplar of
      metrical license and ineptitude, for one can find in this interlude virtually any meter one
      wishes; syllable-counting and simple-stress lines are mixed with abandon. And after a long
      digression on "low tone" and "level stress," Schröer discusses the meters of Skelton,
      Gascoigne, Wyatt, Lindsay, and Bale again. See also E1292–93. </note>

     <note> Chaucer's metrical skill is much firmer in HF than in BD. Trochaic substitu- tions in
      any of the first three feet appear in both poems, but altogether the fre- quency is higher in
      BD; seven-syllable lines, though, appear more often in HF, suggesting that Chaucer did not
      consider the acephalous line a deformity. Hiatus, "slurring" (elision), and extra-metrical
      syllables before the caesura are also less frequent in HF, but enjambement there is both
      heavier and smoother. By contrast, Gower's octosyllabics are much more regular metrically and
      therefore less interesting and less expressive. </note>

      sounded the final -e suffixed to the rhyme- word at the end of Chaucer's lines even though it
      was of two minds concern- ing whether or not to sound the final -e on words within the line,
      Southworth observes, yet since the -e was entirely inorganic (not pronounced) in Chaucer's day
      and since it is admitted only for purposes of metrical exigency, it must be denied in the
      rhymes since there is no question of filling the meter there. N.B.: Southworth here assumes
      that the Chaucerian line was a decasyllable, a position abandoned entirely in his subsequent

     <note> This last summarizes the position taken in the two monographs; all may be conveniently
      treated together. All of Southworth's theorizing about Chaucer's verse rests on the premise of
      a "fact," recently recovered, that final -e was dis- appearing from the speech of Londoners
      perhaps as early as 1350. From this "fact" Southworth argues that therefore we may not
      pronounce, consider syl- labic, nor allow into the meter these suffixes. And since some of the
      Chaucer MSS have significantly fewer final -e's than others, these MSS must of course be the
      most authoritative ones, even though on other grounds they may seem less reliable. Hence,
      Southworth comes to make a direct assault on the well- fortified position of all those who
      believe that Chaucer wrote in meter, specifi- cally an iambic pentameter meter. Southworth's
      counter to this "unsupported and improbable theory": Chaucer wrote "not in regular metre, but
      in rhythms or phrasal units"--meter did not appear in English poetry until Wyatt. In short,
      Southworth wishes to abolish meter, and only consider Chaucer's lines as "rhythmical," or else
      he intends to conflate the two under the latter, believing that pronunciation = meter. He
      views the standard Chaucerian line as having four stresses, a natural family characteristic in
      the alliterative genealogy. To de- note the rhythm of the verse he adopts Thomson's (E404)
      musical scansion- notation, since all the rest of the scholars--Tyrwhitt, Child, Ellis,
      Furnivall, Skeat, Schipper, Ten Brink--were wrong, utterly wrong, wrong about every-
      thing--Chaucer's pronunciation, texts, verse-structure, intention. All the theo- ries about
      the sources of his metric being either the Italian endecasyllable or the French decasyllable
      are mere "Myths." Only the struggling eighteenth-century editor Urrey, the editor most
      cavalier with his MSS, was right. Urrey, that is, and Southworth. In his second monograph
      Southworth draws upon the researches of Clemoes on MS punctuation and Schlaunch on the cursus
      in order to argue that the virgule was intended by the scribes to divide each line into
      hemistichs, each of which was then scannable as one of the standard types of cursus. He seems
      unaware of the work of Fijn Van Draat (J82) on the cursus in OE; that scholar concluded that
      the cursus as a conscious device in verse and prose was a chimera, representing nothing other
      than the normal phrasal stress-patterns of the language. </note>

      homogeneous in its amorphous, loosely structured fluidity, Spina finds that a two-stress line
      is the norm, and metrical expansions of that base are thematically expressive. Broader yet
      closer study of metrical irregularity in Skelton is needed. Ten Brink (see vol. 2 pt. 2 of his

      Pope, and Pilch (K295) and gives a critique of each, especially the last. His own view is that
      the Layamonic verse cannot be measured as a classi- cal alliterative line: it consists of
      half-lines of from four to thirteen syllables, in four double measures, in 2/4 time. It is a
      "monopodic verse which realizes the traditional dipodic alliterative rhythm only rarely."
      Prose stress and metrical ictus generally coincide, and the anacrusis, like the
      syllable-count, the distribu- tion of stresses, and the filling of bars, is free. Layamon's
      verse is closer to the short rhymed couplet in its freer forms than it is to the alliterative
      long-line. </note>

      of inflections, the assimilation of foreign vocabulary, and the induction of a positional
      principle (word order) into the syntax, and the effect of these three major shifts on meter.
      But he cannot very well explain his judgment that "the change from the Old English verse to
      the iambic norm [was] quite slight" merely by arguing that both systems allow for variation
      against a norm or that the OE long-line seems distinctly iambic at times. All these

     <note> Challenges the received explanation of the origin and name of the "rhyme royal" stanza
      (from its use by King James I of Scotland for the Kingis Quair) by showing from ample evidence
      of English civic pageantry that the stanza was used at least as early as the fourteenth
      century for poetic contests in the Puy (guild) and was firmly associated with addresses to
      royalty. Chaucer's use of the form in Troilus and the Canterbury Tales is examined. But more
      importantly, Stevens shows that Chaucer used the term "prose" to refer not only to unlined
      sentences (the modern sense) but also to the rhyme royal stanza (the medieval sense of prosa),
      while reserving rym for either couplets or the tail-rhyme Sir Thopas stanza. Chaucer certainly
      did not invent the form; he simply established its register--the high style--for nearly three
      centuries, and he was "the first poet in the language to endow the long poem with a
      sophisticated and uni- form stanzaic unit." Stevens seems to be completely unaware of the
      earlier monograph by Maynard (K250), however; had he seen that study, part of this essay would

      Langland's verse can be reconciled if we see the line as written in four dipodic feet. The

     <note> A crucial essay on the crucial question in the history of English verse, the question of
      what happened, precisely, to the OE verseform in the ME period. Stobie takes the intrepid
      position that the radical changes in English verse which occurred in the ME period were not,
      essentially, the result of the im- ported Romance forms but would have occurred in any event
      due to natural changes in the phonology of the language. These changes were three: (1) the
      gradation of vowels, reduction of grammatical cases, and subsequent loss of in- flectional
      endings increased the number of monosyllables and altered such forms as OE Type A, /X/X, to
      /X/, //, XX//, and finally X/X/ --that is, the generally trochaic OE rhythm was changed, as a
      result of the lost inflec- tions, to a prevalently iambic one; (2) the lengthening of OE
      vowels in open stressed syllables blocked resolution of double short syllables, adding extra
      syl- lables everywhere, and causing the collapse of the relatively distinct OE Types into one
      general, amorphous Type; and (3) the shortening of the second sylla- ble in compounds had a
      similar blurring effect, adding weak syllables until "the temporal values in alliterative
      poetry disappeared and the native verse became entirely accentual." </note>

     <bibl> Swallow, Alan. "The Pentameter Line in Skelton and Wyatt." MP 48 (1950): 1–11.</bibl>
     <note> Analysis of the early verse of the two poets allows Swallow to conclude that Skelton was
      using the pentameter form before Wyatt, that both men under- stood the five-foot form very
      early in their careers, and that their verse is much more regular metrically than has been
      supposed. For support of these conclu- sions, Swallow argues that the mute -e is pronounced
      and muted variously (as in Chaucer), that Romance words are to have English pronunciations,
      that Wyatt aimed at faithful matter over meter in his translations, and (finally) that the
      metrical tradition which these poets inherited was a very loose one. Many of their lines more
      closely resemble the fifteenth-century bipartite line de- scribed by C. S. Lewis (K216) than
      the pentameter line. So, their metrical context was weak, and their adherence to the
      pentameter must be seen as an effort at codification. See the critique by Evans (E987).

      tience, and Sir Gawain can be matched to the two-beat Five Types "without difficulty," though
      he believes that its meter is generally anapestic-dactylic, a view which requires considerable
      manipulation of the sounded inflectional -e to be viable at all. The rhythm of the long lines
      has influenced that of the short lines, but alliteration does not always correlate with
      primary stresses; the short lines are in an alternating meter with end-rhyme, the alliteration
      being merely ornamental. Discussed in Borroff (K32), chapter 7 and Notes. </note>

     <note> Trautmann published articles on Middle English versification over nearly two decades,
      and after he became editor of the Bonner Beiträge zur Anglistik, the ar- ticles that were
      published in that organ by his students and others all generally followed his philosophy, so
      that his influence extends well over four decades. During that time Trautmann never changed
      his opinion of the nature of Laya- mon's meter: he believed the half-line to be comprised of
      four stresses (as Lachman and the other proponents of the vierhebungstheorie had held for Old
      English verse), with a weakening of the off-verse in the ME period, so that the ME long-line
      had seven stresses instead of the eight in OE. Trautmann held this view for ME from the very
      beginning, even when he suffered a temporary lapse and championed the two-stress theory for OE
      briefly. Trautmann's opinions changed in other respects, however, and it is important to
      notice that he changed his position radically after 1895 not on the nature but on the source
      of Layamon's meter. In his first studies (K405) Trautmann had held that the verseform of the
      Brut was derived from Otfrid and through him ultimately from Medieval Latin, though later
      (J317, J318) he thought that it was derived originally from Otfrid and not from any earlier
      Latin source. After 1895, how- ever (J319), he abandoned the Otfridian thesis and argued that
      Layamon's ver- seform was derived directly from Old English. Several of Trautmann's students
      (i.e. Fischer, Mennicken, Kramer, Pilch, Schneider, and Steffens, q.v.) ex- tended his version
      of the vierhabungstheorie to most of Middle English verse. But that theory has not been borne
      out by later scholarship and their work has no independent authority. </note>

     <note> A much more rigorous, detailed, and exhaustive analysis than those of Schiller (K329)
      and Borroff (K32) and a worthy successor to Luick's study (K224). In the verse of Sir Gawain
      the alliterative structure has become slightly discon- tinuous with the accentual one, the
      staves not always matching the primary stresses, and it is useless to search for concealed
      correct or obvious degenerate OE verse-types. The syntactic unit of the verse is the whole
      line not the hemistich, and its characteristic pattern is a longer a-verse in rising rhythm
      followed by a shorter b-verse in falling. The prevalent rhythm is triple time, of three
      general types, variegated by a less frequent, shorter, duple-time rhythm, often in the
      b-verse, also of three types. Both are "syntactically conditioned . . . by major constituents
      in spaced construction." Alliteration is regular in the short rhythms but frequently irregular
      in the standard triple-rhythm verses, with one major stress not alliterant being relatively
      common. Alliteration is still syntacti- cally functional, but not metrically. Altogether,
      though the meter is much less tight than in OE, the syntax, alliteration, and accentuation
      systems are all still operating conjunctively. </note>

     <note> To be compared with Oakden (K274): this is not a new theory but a codifica- tion and
      restatement of the older theory. The theory of continuity as set forth by Oakden,
      Turville-Petre finds "hard to accept"; he argues the alternative hy- pothesis that "the
      tradition of 'classical' Old English poetry died out soon after the Conquest, and that for
      over one hundred years it was succeeded by a looser form of alliterative verse, which in turn
      died out, though not before it had sown the seeds of the Alliterative Revival." That is, early
      MEAV such as Layamon's Brut "are not milestones in a developing tradition, but examples of
      individual modifications to a fluid and imprecise verseform. . . . At all events the poetry of
      the Alliterative Revival is not a direct descendant of Layamonic verse." Chapter 3 treats the
      meter of the Alliterative Revival poems, Turville- Petre distinguishing three phases: the
      earliest, where the meter is over-loose, followed by a second, where the meter overreacts to
      the earlier form by be- coming over-tight, and a final stage of synthesis, where the meter has
      made adjustments in both directions to become a supple and vitalic medium. Even though this
      meter seems best suited for narration and description, "the most remarkable quality of the
      alliterative line is its capacity to accommodate a vast range of expression." </note>

      the Essay, pp. 46–111. The first modern assessment of Chaucer's metric. Many of Tyrwhitt's
      judg- ments have been subsequently reversed or amended, yet for its time his analysis is
      relatively thorough and close. He believed that rhyme and meter did not exist in English
      poetry before the Conquest, Anglo-Saxon verse having only "pomp of diction," rhyme having come
      into ME through the offices of the Normans from Medieval Latin. He seems to have been the
      first to detect the syllabic regularity of the Ormulum, and indeed syllabism is a very strong
      point with Tyrwhitt. He takes as his ground assumption the belief that a melodic smoothness is
      the unquestionable perfection of metrical style, and hence aim of all the best poets, and
      since Chaucer was a great poet, all deviations and ir- regularities must be the work of shoddy
      scribes and imperfect MSS, and the editor is therefore more than justified in removing these
      blemishes in every instance. This is to say that Tyrwhitt was a wholesaler in emendations. The
      irregularities of meter he lists as: supernumerary syllables (few), deficiency of syllables
      (frequent), and displacement of stress. Deficiency he considers espe- cially grievous (no
      "heroic verse which wants a syllable of its complement can be musical, or even tolerable") and
      to be corrected by sounding of final -e's (Tyrwhitt in fact sounded them everywhere, both
      within the line and on the rhyme-words) and by trisyllabic substitutions ("an English verse,
      though chiefly composed of feet of two syllables, is capable of receiving feet of three
      syllables in every part of it, provided only one of the three syllables be ac- cented"). These
      strategies Tyrwhitt employed to regularize the count of sylla- bles and the alternation of
      stresses, thereby assuring the "correctness and har- mony" of the verse. He was in fact a
      strict syllabist even though he believed that the Chaucerian line contained eleven syllables
      rather than ten, being de- rived from the Italian endecasyllabo. Chaucer's meters he lists as
      the "long Iam- bic Metre" [fourteener], the Alexandrine, the Octosyllabic, the Stanza of Six
      [tail-rhyme], and the Heroic. The discussion concludes with an analysis of ll.1– 18 of the
      General Prologue. </note>

     <note> Extending the hypothesis of Kaluza (K182) and Duggan (K93) supporting quatrain stanzas
      and supra-stanzaic strophes in ME poetry, Vaughan finds that the alliterative MA is divided
      into quatrain-like "four-line thought groups" bound in a "structural" (not ornamental) pattern
      of alliteration that is easily demonstrable though also extremely diffused: over 4,346 lines,
      the number of patterns per number of lines of extension was 948 twos, 95 threes, 189 fours, 12
      fives, 27 sixes, 3 sevens, 4 eights, 1 nine, 3 tens, and 1 eleven. Given such evident range,
      he can only conclude that the MA is "not a stanzaic poem, at least not by any common
      definition of that term, but neither is it a poem whose sole formal feature is the
      alliterative long line. It exists as a tertium quid." There is also some very rough and very
      ambiguous evidence for strophes. </note>

     <note> Waldron departs from traditional oral-formulaic theory by suggesting that even literate
      poets working solidly within a written tradition were capable of using formulae, that ME
      alliterative verse shows clearly the presence of such formu- lae, and that this fact
      establishes the continuity of verseform in Old and Middle English. Criticized by Finlayson

     <note> Within a metrical theory which distinguishes meter from rhythm and, within rhythm,
      simple rhythms (congruence of metrical paradigm with its realizations) from complex
      (disjunction or contrast), Walsh concludes, from analysis of The Parlement of the Three Ages,
      The Siege of Jerusalem, and Sir Gawain, that four- teenth-century verse evolved from (simple)
      dance-rhythms to (complex) speech- rhythms. </note>

     <bibl> West, Henry S. The Versification of "King Horn." Diss., Johns Hopkins, 1899. Baltimore:
      J. H. Furst Co., 1907. 92 pp.</bibl>
     <note> Wholly in agreement with Schipper, West attacks vigorously Luick's theory that the
      verseform of the Brut and King Horn is written in a four-beat half-line modeled on Otfrid in
      employing rhyme throughout instead of structural allit- eration. That is, Luick believed that
      these rhymed-alliterative poems repre- sented a tradition in ME verse wholly unrelated
      to--underived from--the na- tive tradition of the alliterative long-line (two stresses to the
      half-line) in Old English. Wells agrees with Schipper that the Horn verse is within the native
      "free-rhythm" tradition, even though the alliteration has been exchanged for full rhyme; it is
      precisely this interpretation which allows us to trace a "natural and unbroken development"
      from the native OE verse through the assimila- tion of the Romance prosody in ME into Modern
      English. Otherwise we would be forced to believe in the "fundamental fact of a double prosody"
      in English verse. Where Luick found three discrete prosodies, West and Schipper find one. But
      West denies, equally as vigorously, Schipper's scansion of the Horn verse (half-line) as
      having three stresses; West's analysis takes an unwav- ering stand on Sievers and finds only
      two. Indeed, Schipper is chastized smartly for "compromising" with the Otfridians. Chapters 1,
      2, and 6 and the Conclu- sion are required reading that is particularly absorbing, but pp.
      18–20 are espe- cially good. Any history of English versification must squarely confront and
      clearly explain how the native verseform accommodated itself--if indeed it did--to the
      immigrant principle (rhyme) which quickly took control. The al- ternative interpretations are
      atrophy and assimilation. And even though West's claim that alliterative verse could lose
      alliteration and still survive seems in- credible, assimilation is clearly the preferable
      view. </note>

     <note> Tabulation of the lexical repetitions (word echoes) in a sample of Chaucer's verse
      reveals (surprisingly) that its frequency is very nearly the same as that in the Beowulf. If,
