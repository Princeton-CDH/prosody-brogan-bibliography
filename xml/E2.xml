   <bib> Alden, Raymond Macdonald. "English Rhythm." The Nation 93 (1911): 442-43. </bib>
   <notes> A response to Goodell's review essay (E36); Alden discusses the problems of metrical
    pause (he accepts it) and lengthening of the syllable, and he emphasizes the necessity of the
    abstract concept of the (disyllabic) metrical foot. </notes>

   <notes> In contrast to Alden's earlier English Verse (A1), a collection of examples and extracts,
    the Introduction sets forth his theoretical views on the nature of poetry; the salient chapters
    are 4 and 5 (on metrics) and 6 (on rhyme and stanza forms). His central position is that "two
    elements are equally necessary to the forming of rhythm: the equal time-intervals and the
    stresses which mark them." Meter, then, simply fixes the number of syllables regularly repeated
    in the rhythmic frame. Secondary accent on syllables is allowed, which may be either a stress or
    a slack for metrical purposes, and whever metrical ictus conflicts with normal word-stress,
    "hovering accent" will resolve the clash into compromise. And "in general, stress is relative
    rather than positive." (All of Alden's stress-rules (p. 172) are ahead of his time.) Quantity,
    though more variable, is relevant too: when the quantity of a syllable is too short for its
    time-interval, either lengthening or a compensatory pause will fill the deficiency; "pauses may
    also fill the place of wholly missing syllables, in order to complete the approximate equality
    of the time-intervals between stresses." The function of meter and the apparent
    interconvertibility of iambic and trochaic meters are explored in detail. Alden reviews several
    scansion systems, evasively, finally settling on the old macron-and breve. Four meters are
    considered basic, and metrical variation is discussed at length, one such device being
    infrequent substitution of pyrrhics and spondees. Far from being a mere student's manual,
    Alden's treatise tackles nearly every major issue in versification head-on, in a sensible yet
    astute approach, with frequent long digressions to review the scholarship on a subject, as well
    as summaries of his own developing arguments. </notes>

   <notes> "To pronounce in one way and scan in another" is not at all unreasonable, because meter
    is a pure abstraction, assumed by the knowledgeable reader, even though it may be "wholly
    discarded or only partially represented in actual utterance." This axiom will account for
    "metrical rests" and explain how stresses outside of ictus are demoted in utterance while slacks
    under ictus may be promoted. Isochronism is only a subjective reality, even though the metrical
    foot has both a temporal and syllabic character, Alden admits. He agrees with Omond that "rising
    and falling rhythms" are essentially the same meter, and he deplores the whole conception of
    acoustics research as a legitimate method in metrics. </notes>

    Criticizes J. M. Robertson (E320). Though Alden would "certainly not try to name feet or
    describe lines on any basis other than that of accent," he takes up here the matter of time in
    verse-- that is, rhythm--and examines specifically the Musical Analogy and Quantity. He argues
    that Lanier carried the analogy too far and gives a detailed account of the contrasts between
    verse and music. Variable quantities in English syllables are granted, even though they are not
    metrically ordered, yet Alden argues (this is the crux) that just as speech-accents are adjusted
    in the reading of verse under the pressure of the meter, so too the natural, various syllabic
    quantities may often be adjusted (we know that stressed syllables are commonly prolonged, for
    example), in order that the time-periods between accents will be held equal. Even if it were not
    so cogently prepared for, that conclusion seems reasonable beyond much cavil. </notes>

   <bib> Anderson, Johannes C. "Classification of Verse." Transations of the New Zealand Institute
    42 (1909): 481-533. </bib>
   <notes> In the exceedingly complex (and convoluted) metrical system presented here, Anderson
    identifies and elaborates on nineteen different types of "stress units" (the term chosen to
    supplant the traditional "foot"), the prototypical unit being a fixed period of time demarked by
    stresses and containing from one to four syllables. The very term itself entails a broader
    premise, which Anderson argues directly: English verse is metered with a basic unit of quadruple
    members. Such a premise naturally forces some unusual scansions, as for example when feminine
    endings are considered the first half of a stress-unit completed at the beginning of the
    following line. Very much attention is given to metrical pauses, and the nineteen types of units
    are eventually reduced to only seven for practical purposes. Section 1 of the treatise argues
    that no real distinction can be drawn between "iambic" and "trochaic," and after the subsequent
    section essays the same for anapest, dactyl, and amphibrach, Anderson concludes in the third
    that "absolutely no line of demarcation can be made between duple and triple" meters. No other
    metrists has ever been willing to go that far. </notes>

   <notes> Anderson's metrical system admits only feet of either two or three syllables, with the
    stress always falling on the last (iamb or anapest). But he considers that a unit of three
    initial slacks is possible, though very rare, and here he cites examples from ballads. </notes>

   <notes> Anderson, a New Zealander, was a correspondent with T. S. Omond both in letters and in
    metrical theory. That theory distinguishes poetry from prose by a "temporal metre"--"a rhythm of
    time underlies the words, and once this rhythm has been perceived, syllables can be omitted or
    inserted, accents suppressed . . . without the perception of that rhythm being lost. It is this
    rhythm of time that is metrical. . . . the words and accents float upon the metre." Critical of
    the methods of Guest (E543), Bridges (E491), and Saintsbury (E636), Anderson identifies the
    eight-crested "Romance verse" [i.e., Long Meter] as the stable lyric measure in English. The
    foot is here termed a "stress-unit," and though it seems to him irrelevant whether a stress
    begins or ends the unit, Anderson takes it to end, for the sake of convenience. His scansions
    place a grave accent above the line for "syntactical accents" and a short vertical mark below
    the line for "metrical wavecrests," the coincidence of two marks above and below a syllable
    denoting, then, the "metrical stress." Three basic rhythms of verse are identified--those
    consisting of disyllabic, trisyllabic, and quantrisyllabic units--yet strangely enough, Andersen
    argues that the effects of the disyllabic [duple time] and trisyllabic [triple time] rhythms are
    the same; indeed, he thinks that iambic rhythms can become trochaic almost insensibly, based on
    "a variable sonant hover" on every stressed vowel not ending a word: the accented syllable is
    shorted, he thinks, while the following syllable is lengthened (or another syllable inserted in
    the same duration). The four-syllable rhythm is also discussed at length, it being a compound
    form of the disyllabic rhythm. Line and stanza forms occupy the remainder of the book. </notes>

   <notes> Defining rhythm as "an uninterrupted succession of equal divisions of time, each more or
    less filled with sound," Anderson devotes considerable attention to ballad meter, which he
    persists in (mistakenly) analyzing by the apparatus for foot-verse (rather than stress-verse),
    the foot. To analyze stress-verse in feet is a category mistake, of course, but what is more
    surprising here is that Anderson makes very little of his Temporalist assumptions, instead
    emphasizing that "all blank verse, all ballad verse . . . is essentially iambic" and arguing
    that all the other meters are secondarily derived from the iambic, which itself is modelled on
    our internal cardiac rhythms. </notes>

    Institute 41 (1908): 410-18. </bib>
   <notes> The scheme does seem natural enough; it has three categories--the eight- stressed
    (sixteen syllables) Ballad line, which by variations of initial and final syllables can be
    transformed as far as the six-stressed (twelve-syllabled) line; the five-stressed Heroic line,
    including Couplet and Blank Verse forms; and Irregularly lined forms, e.g. Odes and
    pattern-poems. Both the Ballad and Heroic verse may be found in continuous and Stanzaic
    arrangement. Table of forms and subforms appears on p. 412; many examples with scansions follow.

   <bib> -----. "The Verse-Unit." Transactions of the New Zealand Institute 43 (1910): 606- 55. </bib>
   <notes> Follows E273. The next higher level of metrical organization, above that of "stress
    units," is the "verse unit," consisting (in the full form) of eight stresses and often printed
    in two halves, each half more commonly known as a "line." The native British meter was of course
    the Ballad verse (seven stresses), but it was joined after the Conquest by the Romance verse
    (eight stresses), which had two offspring, the Nibelungen verse and the Alexandrine (each of six
    stresses). Anderson works out all the rhythmical and typographic (i.e. stanzaic) variations of
    these verses, but really, unless one wants examples, the whole genealogy is summarized (rather
    technically) in the dense concluding section (pp. 642-55). </notes>

    Transactions of the Philological Society, 1860-61, pp. 45-62. </bib>
   <notes> Omond (A5) thought this "a remarkable paper," primarily I think on account of its scope.
    Barham accepts that modern meter is based on "tone, or accent," though he ushers in the old
    quantities as well by noting the "obvious" fact that "the syllable which contains most
    articulate utterance will occupy the longest time in pronunciation." But he also defines "the
    due observation of time in the recitation of metre" as Rhythm [this indeed is very exact], he
    admits metrical rests, he recognizes isochrony, and he thinks scansion by dipodies simpler. Yet
    the treatment of ancient meter in the last half of the essay surely colors heavily that of
    modern in the first, and we can hear not far behind all this the schoolboy doctrines of a
    classical prosody applied to English verse. Here is the best instance of the conflation and
    confusion of Temporalist and quantitative theories. </notes>

   <notes> Ostensibly an attempt to explain the eight items in Housman's famous footnote (E297), the
    article actually ranges very far afield from direct answers to Housman's questions to a more
    general account of the processing of temporal events in human perception, which is the real
    subject here. Several of Housman's questions remain effectively unanswered. But the account
    given here of the precedence effect is simply fascinating. </notes>

   <notes> Opposed to all objective theories or measurements of verse, the authors hold that
    metrical pattern inheres "in the perception not in the signal," wherein the mind engages in an
    active perceptual patterning, a pattern of expectation (of stressing recurring at equal
    intervals) projected. As support for this temporal theory of meter the authors record
    schematically some "unled choral reading" of verse by a group [consider the socio-dynamics and
    assumptions behind this method]. The verse is "Pease Porridge Hot," Dickenson, Tennyson, all of
    it close to if not actually stress-verse, so we are not surprised when they "discover" the
    metrical pause. </notes>

   <notes> An attempt to answer three of Housman's provocative questions (E297), and with due notice
    of Prall (E318) and Schramm (E428), Bracher argues that every pentameter line is followed by a
    test of one foot (he will not allow metrical rests shorter than a full foot); indeed, all lines
    having an odd number of feet are followed by such a rest, though even-footed ones are not, on
    the grounds that humans naturally tend to compound simple rhythmic impulses, but odd-numbered
    rhythms cannot be resolved into simple groups. Thus blank verse is six-footed in actuality. As
    for the paradox of line-combinations: lines having the same number of feet should combine easily
    whether entirely filled with sound or ending in a rest; verses of different feet will combine
    well if both end in rests but not otherwise. Thus tetrameters and trimeters, and pentameters and
    trimeters, but not tetrameters and pentameters. Finally, tetramemeter verse, being entirely
    filled with sound, requires a rhyme to mark the line-end for the ear. Beguiling sense or
    nonsense? </notes>

    on Dallas in TLS, 18 January 1936, pp. 41-2. "A verse depends on the order and nature of its

    the relative sharpness of tones. Their sharpness depends upon time; upon the number of their
    vibrations in a given time. . . . Such, then, is metre in its simplest form--time heard." To the
    units of meter Dallas applies the term "bars," and he associates the three principal types of

    1880. pp. 423-50. </bib>
   <notes> Saintsbury (History of English Criticism, p. 512) approved of Gurney's work because it
    recognized that the "music" of poetry is quite different from music itself, that metrical rhythm
    is imposed upon, not latent in, speech," and that the sound-stratum of a poem can augment its
    meaning--"the setting includes a new substance." His book is a study of musical form and the
    psychology of acoustical perception, and in chapter 19 he sets forth a theory of meter based on
    his studies in music. Stresses occur at equal intervals of time, feet may contain from one to
    five syllables, and rests may fill up deficient measures. But the distinction (which Saintsbury
    noted) that Gurney draws between verse- music and tonal-music proper is sharply made: the ictus
    in music normally falls first in the bar, whereas in verse it often falls last; "there is no
    significance in this difference, which in no way affects the common feature of regular accents."
    If iambic verse were set to music, the accented syllables would fall first in the musical bars
    but still last in the meter. "The difference. . .is a mere matter of the eye. See also the essay

   <notes> The essay is the opening one of Hunt's Imagination and Fancy of 1844. Much of the piece

    planeting' of the poet's creations, which is produced of necessity by the smooth tendencies of
    their energy or inward working, and the harmonous dance into which they are attracted round the
    orb of the beautiful." Its virtues are "strength, sweetness, straightforwardness,
    unsuperfluousness, variety, and oneness." "Strength is the muscle of verse, and shows itself in
    the number and force of the marked syllables. . . . Unexpected locations of the accent double
    this force, and render it characteristic of passion and abruptness. . . . Weakness of
    versification is want of accent and emphasis." Hunt detests inverted syntax but praises

    false law, classifying verse by the mere number of accents; and in place of scansion we are
    offered new and far more complex rules which, notwithstanding their great laxity, are
    inapplicable to much good verse. We conclude that the new theory is of small value." Jenkin
    himself is a Timer, though he speaks most often of stress, yet he also wishes to preserve the
    old terms of long and short [it is not clear if he means these as simply ictic and non-ictic],
    allowing "a pause followed by a weak syllable" to count as a long. But he will allow spondees
    and pyrrhics to be stronger and weaker varieties of the iamb, and he shows an astute recognition
    that two systems operate simultaneously in the metrical line- -"grouping by section"
    (syntactic-semantic units) and "grouping by feet" (meter). Within his catch-all theory that
    recognition (see pp. 159-60) is an island of surprising clarity and cogency. </notes>

   <notes> Rev: by Rudmose-Brown in the Irish Review 3 (1913): 52-54. The book represents a theory
    of meter which was derived from M's original study of Campion's Observations but subsequently
    assumed larger proportions, so that the final result is bivalent in character but essentially
    theoretical. M. draws heavily on Omond, but surpasses him in drawing, as the axiom of his whole
    approach, an explicit distinction between Song-Verse and Speech-Verse. Both are comprised of
    accent and quantity, in isochronous periods, but in speech-verse the units are additionally
    regulated by "weight" (undefined). Song-verse originated in music, whereas speech-verse arose
    from discourse even though it may become oratorical. The present volume treats only song- verse.
    Also discussed: music and meter; quantitative and accentual verse. MacDonagh, a well-known Irish

   <notes> In his first monograph Omond posits his axiom that the "period" not the "foot" is the
    unit of English meter. Our verse exhibits quantity (metrical quantity is not to be confused with
    natural linguistic quantity), accent (too fickle to serve as a basis for meter), and pause [here
    Omond fails to distinguish stress-verse from syllable-counting verse], but its crucial feature
    is time not accent. There is no real distinction between iambic and trochaic, or anapestic and
    dactylic, meters; the only true meters in English are "common time" and "triple time." But in
    any event all that the prosodist can hope to elucidate are the Principles of verse, not any
    fixed Rules. Omond surveys briefly the theories of Symonds, Bridges, Guest, Poe, Jenkin,
    Sylvester, Steele, and Ellis. Note his rather over-emphatic denial (on p. 54) of any character
    that he is confusing meter with rhythm; that tone of defensiveness is indeed justified. </notes>

    and Omond on "Metre," pp. 517-18, 542). The Temporalist theory of verse-structure, deriving from
    Sir Joshua Steele in 1775 (E393), has been most forcefully promoted in our own century by Omond,
    who is very likely also the most articulate spokesman in the entire tradition, This monograph is
    the formal statement of his theory, as opposed to his other works of a
    historical/bibliographical nature. "All meter is essentially rhythmical. That is to say, it
    consists of equal units ["periods"], uniform as regards duration. . . . If periods constitute
    rhythm, they must do so by uniform succession. Syllables do not supply this absolute recurrence;
    their order of succession is changeful, capricious. They need to be contrasted with underlying
    uniformity. That substratum seems afforded by time. Isochronous periods form the units of metre"
    (italics original). The axiom of the theory, then, is that the verse-line is a temporal
    phenomenon constituted of equidurational segments. Accents are mainly "signaling elements" used
    simply to mark or signal periodicities. Accent cannot be the constituent or base of meter, Omond
    argues, because stress rules in English are too fickle to regulate verse: word-accent is too
    easily disfigured by sentence-accent (but see p. 24). Omond cautiously accepts Blake's theory of
    monopressures (E484) to explain the physiology of accent. Quantity is acknowledged a fact of our
    language and our verse, though ornamental rather than constitutive; poets who write verse "based
    solely on quantity may be said to sin against the genius of their language." Metrical pause is a
    crucial component of meter as well, this to be distinguished from the various pauses for effect
    in performance. Of metrical types Omond allows four: two measures, duple and triple, in two
    modes, rising and falling. (Blake's theory allows a maximum of three syllables per
    monopressure.) Readers with keen noses may detect here the bouquet of old wine in new bottles.

    which is defined as the recurrence of accents at regular intervals of time, the accented
    syllable being either followed or preceded by as many as two unaccented ones. Meter then becomes
    merely the building-up of lines from such "rhythmic" "feet." He allows nine such "feet," finding
    the pyrrhic "very frequent." Worse still, it seems to matter little whether the accent is marked
    at the end of the foor or at the beginning. Parsons reinterates his concern for equal-timing but
    in practice only marks stresses. Such ambivalences are the seeds and sprouts of anarchy.

   <notes> This is unquestionably the best available discussion of the general nature of temporality
    in the form of the poem, with its implications for our understanding of the ontological status
    of "the poem," and hence the modes of respose which are available for criticism. Critics as a
    rule have been more than reluctant to even admit that a poem might have a temporal dimension,
    formally (some metrists have argued quite the reverse, of course), even though they recognize
    obvious temporal structuring in narration or plotting. But such a reluctance constitutes a
    confession of ignorance, and the perpetuation of it an appeal to ignorance. Some recent
    codifications in metrical theory offer hope of a solution, and the key to the whole problem
    might well be "abstract metre apprehended as a temporal construct." But in fact there are a
    number of "clocks" simultaneously regulating the timing of poetry (though note: the notion of
    isochonous lines in verse is false). Too, timing effects may arise from lexical and semantic
    levels as well as formal, if not all of these together. A proper temporal analytic should be
    operable at both the macro- and the micro-levels of the art-work. An extraordinarily dense yet

   <bib> Eaton, Richard B. "Poet's Prosody in Perspective." Poe Studies 5 (1972): 61-62. </bib>
   <notes> Eaton takes issue with Greenwood's opinion of Poe's prosody by showing in detail the
    difficulty--and necessity--of an accurate historical understanding of prosodic thought in Poe's
    time, or any time. Poe "marked stresses, he confused them with quantities, and he counted
    syllables." Thus the temporalist theory of one age overlaps the stress theory of another age,
    and both are only partly or vaguely understood by poets as well as grammarians of the time. Is
    it any wonder prosody is so hard to read aright? The "Rationale" essay is an amplification of an
    earlier study, "Notes on English Verse," published in The Pioneer for March 1843. With his
    accustomed vigor of tendentious rhetorical argumentation, Poe takes up the standard of the old
    longs and shorts, insisting on the quantitative terminology for English as well as Latin. Accent
    determines length, but Poe's system of prosody really rests on time. Admitting that quantity is
    infinite in gradation yet clutching the dogma of one-long-equals-two-shorts, Poe is driven, by
    the fact of extrametrical syllables in lines, to devise a cumbersome--nearly ludicrous-- system
    of halves, thirds, and sixths, indicating syllabic duration in scansion with numbers and
    fractions, and allowing, besides the only feet he recognizes-- iamb, trochee, anapest, dactyl,
    spondee, and "caesura" (a single long syllable)-- a host of other misbegotten siblings: "bastard
    iamb," bastard dactyl," etc., and the "quick trochee." His refusal to admit pyrrhics into the
    system is transparently casuistical. And Poe differentiates rhythm from meter only in that the
    former identifies the feet while the latter denotes the number of feet per line, which is
    scarcely any cutting distinction. Altogether, the conservatism and the confusion in Poe's
    thinking produce an extravagently indefensible system. Yet against this one must say that the
    "Rationale" essay has been fertile ground for subsequent work: we find here the notion that a
    poetic line must "read itself" (be incapable of misarticulation), and concept of the "variable
    foot," and the abstract principle of "equality" (also termed "proportionality" and "equivalence"
    developed so importantly a century later by a distinguished Slavist and linguist. The
    "Philosophy of Composition" and "Poetic Principle" essays contain some remarks on versification
    that are too familiar to require notice. The "Marginalia" (vol. 16, pp. 111-12 in the Complete
    Works) reiterate Poe's fascination with strict laws of mathematics, and he reminds us that laws
    deduced from observable effects are by no means identical to those controlling composition. The
    salutary effect of rhyme is said to depend on recurrence at "unanticipated intervals." Finally,
    Poe's 1843 review of The Poets and Poetry of America contains a short synopsis of his views of
    versification (vol. 11 of the Works, pp. 225-36). </notes>

    matter how comprised; notation consists of a linear graph under the verse, marked off with short
    vertical lines, so as to denote the greater or lesser duration of the words in the feet by
    greater or lesser extension along the line. Finally, to confound clarity altogether, "feet are
    distinguished by accent and quantity. But, as feet distinguished by accent and quantity do not
    constitute different species of metre, but only give by their mixture an agreeable variety to
    the cadence; and as accent is the more general mark of distinction, and also commonly

    expressive effects acheived by stress-patterns in lines of verse are not rhythmical because both
    rhythm and meter are "essentially temporal structures." Schwartz gives an Aristotelian account
    of rhythm: whereas the drama can only reproduce the external signs of inner emotion in others,
    rhythm "corresponds in its movement with the movement of the soul" directly. For Schwartz,
    whatever is abstracted is meter; the rhythm is inseparable from performance. Meters he thinks
    may correspond to "general classes of feelings." All this is wooly, which Perry has little
    trouble showing in his reply. Imitative and expressive metrical effects are not to be denied,
    and Schwartz's whole account of the treatment of emotions in poetry is superficial, as is his

    Schwartz's reply to Wimsatt and Beardsley (E700) perceives clearly that unless they "recognize
    the psychological status of rhythm, they cannot be made to see its temporal basis." W &amp; B
    amplify Leonard Meyer's distinction between pulse, rhythm, and meter, then clarify their own
    position: "meter. . . is what we actually hear in the poem when it is read aloud; rhythm is
    something which is aroused in the mind by means of the poem's meter, something which is felt by
    the listener and which in turn stirs his further feelings." (Thus, for them meter is objective,
    rhythm subjective, while for Schwartz meter is subjective and rhythm objective.) S. responds
    with his counterassertion "that meter is real, that it is distinct from rhythm, and that both
    meter and rhythm are temporally measured." Being perfectly abstract, meter is never actually
    heard, but rather is inferred: It "exists in the mind of the reader" as a "normative pattern" of
    expectation. What we actually perceive are the strong stresses and the temporal intervals
    between them, intervals roughly but not precisely equivalent. It is neither necessary nor
    possible to show that syllabic durations are physically equal. "Meter is an ideal temporal
    norm." The meter and rhythm are correlated by the reader simultanously, via "double audition."
    Schwartz argues that inverted feet are preceded by pauses, so that "trochaic substitutions" are
    actually a pause + a monosyllable + an anapest. W &amp; B's final response expresses skepticism
    as to this last and reasserts their belief that Schwartz actually proves their own case.

    "iambic" poems, discovering thereby that the proportions of all three are in each case quite
    mixed, with many neutrals, and that the falling phrases are only slightly more frequent in
    "trochaic" verse than in "iambic," and not at all predominant even within the "trochaic." All
    that one can say is that the mixes are pretty thorough and that we discriminate some extremely
    subtle shifts quite markedly. But the distinctions "iambic/trochaic" and "rising/falling"
    Stewart finds unwarranted. Cf. Newton (E799), Hascall (E783), Creek (E18), Crapsey (E516), and
    Atkins (E467). </notes>

   <notes> Extending his earlier work on the ballad meters, Stewart shows that the pattern x - | x -
    | x - | x - | x - | x - | x - is a septenary in Pope but a dipodic line in Kipling, based on the
    proportional frequency of occurrence of each of the parts of speech in each position. But a more
    simplified analysis a Dipodic Index can be derived for a given poem, and Stewart finds that
    dipodism begins to be clearly perceived at about index 35. But the most intriguing question of
    all is that of the tendency toward dipodic structure in the stress system of the language
    itself. </notes>

   <notes> One of the most substantial studies published in the first half of this century; Stewart
    is perhaps the least temporal (certainly the least dognatically so) of Timers, and his book can
    make that theory more attractive to confirmed Stressers than any of the rest. His approach
    offers two distinctive and significant features: Phrasing, and Dipodism. For scansion the
    following siglia are employed: S O o p l P = = = = = = stressed syllable heavy unstress
    unstressed syllable pause for an unstress light stress pause for a stress; these Stewart deploys
    in groups in scansions so as to indicate not only the stress- pattern of the line (note he has
    four levels available rather than two) but also the syntactic structure, the phrasal boundaries.
    The system is simple, efficient, and doubly informative. Notice that Stewart's simple and
    compound phrasing corresponds precisely to constituent analysis in structural linguistics, and
    that by including phrase-structure he is able to account for "rising" and "falling" rhythms more
    adequately than anyone else. On the temporal aspect he is modest but firm: the "time-structures"
    of verse are "practically identical," and so Stewart begins the first foot of the line with the
    first stress. Unfortunately this forces him to call a 5-foot line a 4-foot line with "a little
    left over at beginning and end" which is neither elegant nor efficient, and Stewart wisely
    chooses not to pursue this course. He allows four feet--the monosyllabic, iambic, trochaic, and
    amphibrachic--and of course he makes much of the metrical pause. When he comes to quadruple
    meters, i.e. Dipodic verse, his analysis again merits praise for charting new terrain. His
    scansion notation allows much further progress than Patmore (E384) was able to make. But notice:
    nearly all his examples are ballads, and the import of his analysis is to rewrite stress-verse
    as a highly regular meter bordering on foot-verse by the liberal insertion of metrical pauses;
    the ultimate result of this tack will be to eliminate entirely the concept of stress-verse,
    where the slack syllables are unconstrained. Much food for thought here. See Stewart's article
    at K379 and his earlier monograph at E892, and see also Stevenson (E400). Note E292. </notes>

   <notes> Not strictly a "timer," Taig is cognizant of the complexity of these matters, and also of
    the natural limitations of assertion: the result is a refreshingly restrained, yet sophisticated
    discourse. He considers both "timers" and "stressers" to be mistaken in believing that any
    single dimension of speech- rhythm is supreme for metrical purposes or solely worthy of
    notation; as an alternative, he employs (with conscious dissatisfaction) two systems, a wave-
    graph and musical notation, to indicate both duration and intensity. Three basic metrical
    patterns or systems are identified: Variable, Doubtful, and Fixed. In the Variable pattern
    (example: Old English alliterative), the constraints are relatively weak. In the Doubtful
    pattern, the numbering of syllables is rigidly controlled but their timing is generally
    uncontrolled, causing metrists to be "doubtful" of the nature of the prosodic base. But as the
    constraints increase, the timing too is Fixed, creating that sort of stress-verse where the
    reader can scarcely miss the intended timing of the line. A long fifth chapter takes up the
    "Spoken Line," a subject, current opinion notwithstanding, which is indispensable to metrics.
    Taig's analysis of the double-stranded rope of performance--the metrical expectation perceived
    simultaneously with the rhythmic/syntactic ordering--raises the tantalizing prospect that "the
    forms employed in the utterance can be reduced to a few well-defined types, that the
    speech-variations of blank verse can be classified at least as easily as those of the
    alliterative line in Old English." This analogy is pursued through a short analysis, and three
    Groups of line-patterns are also identified which seem to operate in the metrical orchestration
    of long passages of verse (5 waves, 4, and 3). A short final chapter traces the parallel
    historical development of rhythmical counterpoint in music and in verse. Replacing Taig's term
    "wave" by the more familiar "bar" or "foot," one might claim that this book is merely old
    familiar tea in an unfamiliar package, yet the seeming glibness of the term belies the broad
    learning and deep thinking consistently evidenced here. Any reader who believes that deep
    thinking can come to a trivial and conventional conclusion does not understand deep thinking.
    This is a difficult book, in both the negative and positive sense of the word. See also: B122,

    (E88). Bayfield pushes the musical analogy to verse to its ultimate logical end, that is, into
    absurdity: since the stress begins the bar in music, therefore all English verse has always been
    written in a trochaic meter; indeed, by definition, the iambic foot cannot exist. Stress is
    acknowledged central to English verse, but stressed syllables are said to last twice as long as
    unstressed in utterance, and recur at equal intervals, i.e. in "triple-time." Bayfield seems to
    have read none of his contemporaries. Now, Omond's view of this whole business was that the
    whole uproar raised by the appearance of Bayfield's books was pointless and unnecessary, the
    argument itself being tautology and calling for no response. In other words, if everyone is
    agreed on the stressing of a line, it makes no difference where the bar-marks for foot-division
    are drawn: it makes no difference whether we call the line iambic or trochaic. Possibly this
    logic is too radically simple to strike me as correct, but I cannot believe that (1) there is no
    syntactic or metrical difference between what are commonly called "rising rhythms" and "falling
    rhythms," or that (2) the long history of what poets thought they were doing, in writing in the
    iambic pentameter tradition, counts for nothing at all. Cf. his E1093 and E1094. </notes>

   <notes> Essential reading--as much for what is not said as what is. Beardsley turns directly to
    the most important available (and widely ignored) source currently on rhythm in music, Cooper
    and Meyer (N30), summarizing its premises: "in music, meter is pulse plus accent, rhythm is
    accent plus grouping," and "a 'rhythmic pattern' in music is what prosodists are wont to call a
    'metrical pattern' in verse." (Note the implication that rhythm is a higher-order concept than
    meter.) He does not, however, adequately explain their hierarchical scansions, as he does not
    adequately explain his own--his second subject. Proposed is a scansion-system I have not seen
    elsewhere, which appears to account for both metrical pattern and syntactic (i.e. rhythmical)
    grouping, and can explain the complex, unified, double sense of movement in lines of verse that
    we are commonly aware of. Beardsley then reviews, disinterestedly, the arguments for and against
    a musical scansion of verse, as well as the problems in setting verse to music. </notes>

    which is derived from Lanier (E364) and closely parallel to Thomson (E404), whose work Croll
    apparently did not see until its publication in 1923, the date of the first version of his own
    essay. For scansion notation Croll employs a system of superlinear horizontal bar-lines with
    flags to denote time-values. He considers iambic/trochaic verse to be in triple time,
    anapestic/dactylic in duple, so stressed syllables are tacitly granted double the duration of
    unstressed. Following illustration of these two, a long section treats the "double or compound
    measure," i.e. dipodic meter. Here Croll treats the ballad meters, though his attempt to scan
    every ballad as if it were dipodic is very obviously unreasonable. A final section postulates
    the existence of yet one higher level, the "double-compound" (double-dipodic) measure, in effect
    in double- quadruple time, one measure would therefore contain four degrees of stress, i.e.
    This, too, seems an improbable complication, and examples are scarce. </notes>

    one extract: Eliot reminds us that the study of metrics is a useful and necessary occupation but
    only at an early stage, for "a study of anatomy will not teach you how to make a hen lay eggs":
    assimilation and imitation create good poetry, not scansion or analysis. English verse has
    received influence from many foreign verse-forms, and Eliot suggests that there may be two
    systems operant at once in our meter even as accent and quantity both were attended to in late
    Latin verse. But he insists that meter cannot be studied apart from meaning. There is no such
    thing as appreciating the melody of verse without understanding its sense. "Melody" is not mere
    mellifluousness, and the mimetic or semantic range of pure sound is quite limited. Altogether,
    poetry is close kin to conversation, and cannot afford to stray far or long from the common

    shares with music--sound and rhythm," Frye elucidates some of the manifold "confusion between
    the musical and the euphonious" in poetry. "Music" of course is not "beauty of sound" but
    "organization of sound." Hence, "when we find a careful balancing of vowels and consonants and a
    dreamy sensuous flow of sound, we are probably dealing with an unmusical poet. Pope, Keats, and
    Tennyson are all unmusical. . . . When we find sharp barking accents, crabbed and obscure
    language, mouthfuls of consonants, and long, lumbering polysyllables, we are probably dealing
    with melos, or poetry which shows an analogy to music, if not an actual influence from it."
    Metrically, "when in poetry we have a predominating stress accent and a variable number of
    syllables between two stresses . . . we have musical poetry, that is, poetry which resembles in
    its structure the music contemporary with it." Frye believes that behind the iambic pentameter
    lies a four-stress line which "seems to be inherent in the structure of the English language,"
    adducing as proof some musical scansions of lines from Lydgate and Skelton. (This I think is a
    confusion of meter for rhythm.) Imitative effects are also discussed. In sum, Frye posits that
    the two varieties of poetic melos arise "the one from the external influence of music, the
    other, internal, from the language itself." </notes>

   <notes> Intended as an apologia for and simplified exposition of Lanier's system of temporal

    musical notation and with numerals indicating syllabic duration (he believes that the auditor
    can discriminate syllable-lengths of 3⁄4, 1, 11⁄2, and 2). And though Hendren recognizes four
    degrees of stress, his scansions strongly suggest a belief that stressed syllables are doubled
    in length--a ghost we had thought long since buried. Hendren has no evidence for that claim
    other than an appeal to authority, and he recognizes rightly that objective studies of rhythm
    are less relevant than subjective (perceptual) ones. But any thorough study of Lanier will find

   <notes> [Hendren has the first six pages, W &amp; B the last three.] Hendren begins his reply to
    Wimsatt and Beardsley by collapsing several crucial distinctions ("to reject measured time as an
    integral character of metrical structure is to deny the existence of verse rhythm"; "we cannot.
    . . separate meter from the performance"; and tapping out the beats of a blank- verse line "will
    show its triple rhythm and its plain arrangement of long and short syllables"), then argues that
    the isochronism which may be demonstrated in tapping out lines is not mathematically precise;
    the durations are but "sensibly equal." He recites the obligatory temporalist litany of
    Poetry-and- Music, approves the work of Snell, Schramm, and Thomson, then returns finally to a
    methodical countering of the points raised by Wimsatt and Beardsley, especially the picket-fence
    analogy. Wimsatt and Beardsley in their reply expand their scope to Hendren's monograph (E356),
    attacking his assumptions ("measures when recited will often differ enormously") as well as the
    experimental evidence for isochrony. They respond to Hendren's crucial query "If the stresses
    are not measuring time in the recitation of the verse, what are we to suppose they are measuring
    instead?" with a trenchant answer, "Syllables, number of syllables, are measured--syllables
    grouped according to stress and slack, so many slacks between each stress." And they summarize
    their traditional position concisely: "Syllabic quantitative meters are not possible in English
    because syllabic quantity is not an objective feature of English. Isochronism (of intervals
    between primary stresses, as urged by the linguists) is not a principle of English meter,
    because if it is an actual feature of the language, it is a constant feature and is hence not
    susceptible of the manipulation by which the poet distinguishes metrical from non-metrical."
    They even go so far as to disparage Hendren for "the irrelevance of his theory to actual
    problems of English meter." </notes>

   <notes> "Imprint dates on copies vary." Rpt in The Centennial Edition of the Works of Sidney
    Lanier. Vol. II. The Science of English Verse and Essays on Music. Ed. P. F. Baum. Baltimore:
    Johns Hopkins University Press, 1945. (Baum's Introduction should not be overlooked). A seminal
    text in metrical theory, less interesting in itself perhaps than for the sake of the enormous
    influence it exerted on critical conceptions of poetic form for more than forty years after its
    publication. The axiom of all of Lanier's thought is that human speech (and, by extension,
    spoken verse-- poetry) is a sound-phenomenon, produced by a reed instrument (the vocal
    apparatus), and organized in duration , pitch, and intensity (principally the first), making it
    theoretically indistinguishable from music. That is, he conceives of verse and music not merely
    as analogous phenomena but as coincident in origin and correpondent in ordering-principles--"the
    two species of the genus art of sound." From this one axiom of the identity of all patterning of
    Sound, three propositions may be derived which apply equally to music and verse and produce
    differing effects merely due to the qualitative differences in "musical sounds" and "spoken
    words": these propositions express the co-ordinations of the ear in terms of duration, pitch,
    and quality as (respectively) Rhythm, Tune, and Tone-Color. Rhythm, the subject which occupies
    Part I of the treatise, may be classed as primary or secondary and occurs in 3-rhythm and
    4-rhythm modes, as we learn in music. Lanier thinks "no circumstance in the history of
    aesthetics so curious as the overpowering passion of the English [poetic] ear for 3-rhythm as
    opposed to 4-rhythm." For scansion, of course, the line of verse is denoted by a time-signature
    and musical notes expressing the durations of the syllables. Metrical (musical) rests are
    therefore permissible and valuable features of verse-structure. Part II, entirely ignored by
    subsequent scholars, treats Tune; Part III, rhyme (at length), alliteration (short notes), and
    Sylvester's "phonetic syzygy" (E402). Metrical analysis of Shakespeare's verse receives
    considerable attention; see pp. 185-224. Lanier's achievement in the history of metrical theory
    was to systematize the verse-music analogy and to popularize the musical scansion-sigla
    suggested by Sir Joshua Steele (E394) a century earlier. A century later he is not followed at
    all, his musical scansions actually being thought unduly precise and therefore denoting features
    of performance rather than paradigms. And there is the added twist that Lanier's scansions
    depart from all established musical convention in not placing the accented note first in the
    bar--this seems a flagrant inconsistency in the sort of theory where consistency is only less
    crucial a criterion than clarity. Omond (A5) appreciated the book (see pp. 195-202) but
    Saintsbury rattled his armor (A8, vol. 3, pp. 493-97). See also J214. For two modern
    applications of Lanier's theory to Old and Middle English verse, see Pope (J241, J242) and
    Schiller (K329). See also Hendren (E356) and Niessner (E382). </notes>

    from rhythm, though she does hold that "verse feet and measures identify different phenomena,
    both of which are valuable to descriptive prosody." The same meter may have various
    time-signatures (though iambic verse is usually in triple time, stressed syllables being double
    the length of unstressed), though transpositions occur in performance. "Rhetorical accents" are
    preserved as "isochronous accents" in the line even when they do not match the ideal pattern of
    "metrical stresses." The formulations here are new, but the concepts underneath them are not.

    pitch English is by stress, but he considers the guiding principle of versification in both
    languages to be Time, i.e. Music. "Indeed it is the peculiar characteristic of verse in all
    languages . . . that it is speech arranged in musical time." "Time, as essential to music, must
    be essential to verse." In English versification the feet are isochronous measures of time
    "beginning or ending" with a stress, preferably the former, Malden thinks, exactly as in music.

   <notes> A treatise on rhythm--the clausulae of rhythmical prose and the regularized metrical feet

    "Numbers" seems to mean "feet" (pp. 10-11), these being the aggregates of "Rhythms" (12-14),
    both irregular and regular. Of verse (Chapter 4), Manwaring holds that English Versification is
    "made according to the diatonic scale," i.e., the "half and whole Times" of the iambic or
    trochaic feet are analogous to the half and whole steps or Tones in music. Iambic verse on this
    account would be in triple time, and in fact it is barred so that the "first syllable in every
    full foot" is "acuted" (accent is based on pitch here). English verse, we are told near the end,
    must attend to accent, quantity, and "Concord" (caesure-placement); the pentameter "is a seventh
    in music." Fussell's remarks on this work (E34) show only that he failed to read it closely, or

    are not the same as those for the classical languages; he notes a "rhythmizing instinct" in our
    reading aloud of nursery rhymes, as opposed to our "normal unrhythmical enunciation" of speech.

   <notes> Quantity is as distinct from accent in classical Greek as it is in modern English; our
    verse is based on "emphasis," the term "accent" being used for pitch or musical tone, as in
    classical speech. Thereafter, Odell follows Steele (E394) on "cadence": "Rhythmus is a general
    term, comprising two distinct modes, which are called common time and triple time, or common and
    triple metre. . . . rhythmus has its essence in arsis and thesis, but metre in syllables and in
    their difference." Syllable length by position is rejected, and since emphasis is said to have
    controlled quantity even in Greek, "metre is always subordinate to rhythmus." The metrical
    cadence is "equivalent to a musical bar," and so begins an emphatic syllable; it may contain a
    metrical rest, so that all the cadences will have equal duration. </notes>

    Patmore's Poems, 1894. Her bibliography contains 281 entries. The "critics" Patmore has in mind
    are mainly Guest (E543) and O'Brian (M151). Though most of Patmore's ideas were not new at the
    time, still his essay has been very influential, and it stands as one of the three or four major
    documents in the evolution of the Temporal theory of verse. In the essay he pursues vigorously
    the case for verse being divided into "isochronous intervals," though he holds these to be
    perceptually (mentally) equal rather than physically. These intervals are to be demarcated by
    "an 'ictus' or 'beat,' actual or mental. . . . it has no material and external existence at
    all." (One notes the conflation or confusion of metrical ictus and speech stress here.) Mitford
    (E600) and Steele (E394) are praised, and Hegel's Aesthetics provides some further foundation.
    But Patmore's most important and original contribution is his argument that English verse is all
    dipodic: "the elementary measure, or integer, of English verse is double the measure of ordinary
    prose,--that is to say, it is the space which is bounded by alternate accents; that every verse
    proper contains two, three, or four of these 'metres,' or as with a little allowance they may be
    called, 'dipodes.'" He also argues the importance of medial and final metrical pauses. O'Brian's
    work prompts an argument that alliteration in Anglo-Saxon was no mere ornament but a metrical
    device needed to mark the accents; by extension, the, rhyme in modern verse serves a metrical
    function also. See also Stobie (E944) chapter 4 of Holloway (E914), and Patmore (E937). For

    Son, 1779. </bib>
   <notes> Bysshe's influence on the eighteenth century is greater (simply by precedence), but
    Steele is among the two or three most influential figures in the entire history of English
    versification, as well as a major figure in the history of phonetics. He is responsible for
    charting an entirely new course in verse- theory, despite the fact that his magnum opus,
    Prosodia Rationalis, is a treatise on suprasegmental phonology, not metrics. Steele's theory of
    verse influenced Thelwall, Odell, Chapman, and Roe, and after them Coventry Patmore, A. J.
    Ellis, Sidney Lanier, T. S. Omond, and John C. Pope. He devoted his career to devising a set of
    orthographic symbols to transcribe the inflectional features of English speech (stress, pitch,
    and duration) and, by extension, the structure of English verse; these were quasi-musical. Hence
    Steele transfers the structure of music, vis |`a vis verse, from the level of analogy to the
    level of identity. In adapting music to describe verse he was preceded by Gildon (E164), but
    Gildon never applied the idea beyond a mere example. Steele deserves the credit for elaborating
    the system formally; he shrugs off the half-hearted efforts of the earlier prosodists and
    reaches out to grasp the wider theoretical implications of the ideas he is pursuing. Prosodia
    Rationalis, however, is more a book to be read about than read. It began as a reply to Lord
    Monboddo and his doctrine that "the music of our language. . . [is] nothing better than the
    music of a drum, in which we perceive no difference except that of louder or softer." But as
    each section of Steele's argument was completed, he sent it off for Lord Monboddo's comments,
    which were then incorporated along with Steele's replies in subsequent sections of the book:
    "consequently, Prosodia Rationalis is, in effect, an extended dialogue between the two men, to
    which is appended, in the second edition, an additional series of questions from other hands,
    together with the author's replies." (Omond). Steele obviously went far out of his way to
    present his system as even-handedly as possible. His system distinguishes five features: •
    accent: by which Steele means pitch, or tone, and which he is perceptive enough to recognize
    changes in even slides, not in discrete or abrupt shifts; • quantity: meaning relative duration
    of syllables or pauses. Steele uses quasi- musical symbols to denote "accent" and quantity
    simultaneously, the heads denoting the direction of pitch-change, the tails (tails above heads
    in his system), duration: • emphasis: a term Steele uses ambivalently and confusedly to denote
    both the absolute duration between stresses (cadence, bar), and also the stresses themselves,
    based on the analogy of the systolic circulatory system of the human body, the heartbeat of
    which is both regular and intensified. Hence Steele considers syllables either "heavy" or
    "light" (poise is the general term for this phenomenon), and he distinguishes three degrees,
    heavy, light, and lightest; "the rhythmus or measure of speech is the number of cadences in a
    line or stanza"; • pause: in four durations: semibreve, minim, crotchet, and quaver; and •
    force: or loudness, also in four gradations: louder, loud, soft, softer. In versification, time
    not syllables is to be the basis of meter; the concept of the metrical pause originates with
    Steele. But he recognizes also that even if the structure of verse is actually that of music the
    pentameter line cannot be scanned with bar-lines before the stresses, i.e. with a final
    monosyllabic foot and an initial anacrusis; instead, Steele scans it with a stressed rest
    beginning the line and an unstressed rest at the end: (/p) I do not think that you will ever
    know (p). The five-foot line thus becomes a six- or even as much as an eight- in some cases;
    Steele does not seem to mind the extremities of this position. Mixing of common and triple time
    is therefore no problem at all, nor is trisyllabic substitution, since everything depends soley
    on time. Altogether, one may say that Steele's ideas were, with some slight qualifications,
    essentially sound. The notion of emphasis is the chief weakness of his analysis. Some of his
    transcriptions are unreliable, but since he had no technology to support him, no recorders or
    oscilloscopes for playback, he had to rely on his ear alone for the one and only hearing of the
    line. In the history of phonetics he position is very firm. In the history of versification he
    represents the first, perhaps the foremost, proponent of a view that has not been widely
    accepted as the correct account of meter but which has been widely recognized as legitimate,
    even indispensable, as an account of rhythm. After Lanier even several of the prominent Temporal
    metrists shied away from the concept of music as anything more than analogy to verse, yet these
    judgments could be comfortably made from the distance of a century and a half from Steele's
    pioneering work. Reference: Omond (A5), pp. 87-95, Fussell (E34), pp. 139-43. See also the

   <notes> Drawing upon concepts from the earlier work of Steele (E394), Andrews (E335), and Stewart
    (E333), Stevenson deploys a full-fledged theory of English meter that rests on both stressing
    and timing, distinguishes metrical ictus from speech stress, adopts some of the features of the
    analogy of verse to music while recognizing sensibly and explicitly the weaknesses and
    limitations of that analogy, and derives a "foot-free prosody" based on the whole line. With a
    very striking illustration, Stevenson demonstrates the difference between "metrical stress"
    (ictus) and "accent" (speech stress) and the functions of the former: as conspicuously regular
    markers of the metrical paradigm, metrical stresses "have a partitioning effect: they help us to
    see the pattern as composed of sub-patterns. . . . [they] provide consecutive 'frames' that
    divide the total 'picture' into smaller 'pictures.' The frames, moreover, are similar frames. So
    they invite us to compare the pictures within them, noticing when they are alike and when they
    are different. . . . The frames help us to make the visual comparisons on which our sense of
    organization depends." The two features which establish ictus are approximately equal timing and
    limited variability of syllables (i.e. the number of syllables must be relatively small and
    relatively uniform). Stevenson sees that timing is only "a part of the explanation."
    Alliteration, stanza-pattern, and pitch can also occasionally help mark ictus. "Metrical
    stresses are as if ornamental frames, of aesthetic interest in their own right." Music is indeed
    analogous to verse in that the stresses in verse begin "stress-intervals" equivalent to musical
    bars (Stevenson claims that "to call a stress-interval by the name foot" is "entirely
    misleading," but what's in a name? The concept of sub-linear metrical unit is retained.), and
    metrical pauses are admissible, as is syncopation. Yet pauses in verse may be ambivalent, though
    not so in music, and verse-pauses cannot be "held" over several beats as in music, even besides
    the obviously greater syllabic variation possible in music, so the analogy has decided
    limitations and is "always a little misleading" anyway. But syllabic length and syntactic
    phrase-structure, though both quite variable in English verse, are susceptible to marking in
    scansion and should be noticed. Finally, in a long and important penultimate section, Stevenson
    argues that the stubborn retention of the "foot" by prosodists has been a result of a
    fundamental misconception: they have been sidetracked by undue emphasis on the beginning of the
    line and have believed that the metering of the rest of the line must operate on a principle of
    the "best echo" of the onset. But the phrase-structure usually belies any clear echoes, and the
    "foot" therefore appears very artificial. This misconception may have arisen from the general
    nature of poetic composition, which Stevenson hypothosizes operates mainly on the principle of
    limited syllabic variability between ictus, extended also to the line-beginning. Such a general
    principle produces "facts" capable of varying interpretation. Stevenson's interpretation, on the
    whole, is provocative and extensive; his approach is remarkably sensible. </notes>

    Following an opening review (and rejection) of the Pychological approach to poetic rhythm
    (Attention Span and Kinesthesis theories), the author comes to her point and method. "We are
    going to collate the prosody of poetry with that of music." This thesis she will pursue even
    beyond the shortcomings of Lanier and others. "We may define [the foot] in accents, in
    quantities, as an isochronous interval, a monopressure, a centroid. . . . We disagree in almost
    every conceivable way about the composition of the foot, delimiting and refining, but here let
    us take our motto--Prosody, beware of exclusion. There is not one thing, metrical form." This is
    fair, but worse follows: "Consequently we shall not narrow the meaning of foot, but follow
    Saintsbury's lead in shirking a farther definition." But her scansions show not only notes and
    bars but also "feet" which seem to be basically syntactic and word boundaries. She accepts a
    system from Prout's Musical Form providing "Fore Phrase" and "After Phrase," each of these
    having an A and B section, each section having a and b "feet" (exemplified in the hemistichic
    octosyllabic couplet). This system allows her to describe (for fifty pages) complex phrasing
    patterns in verse. See also her essay </notes>

   <notes> An important study, unjustly neglected, which draws some radical conclusions from
    kymograph recordings of speech (Brown makes some trenchant criticisms of the assumptions behind
    all finger-tapping and motor-response methodologies) and applies them to theories of meter and
    rhythm. "There is nothing in the temporal regularity of simpler rhythmic processes which
    contradicts the assumption of a non-temporal theory of rhythm. And the lack of temporal
    regularity in verse makes such an assumption inoperative." There is no equality of durations in
    verse-rhythm. "Is it not natural, then, to conclude that time equality is an inference derived
    from the apparent equality of two impressions or expressions and confirmed by actual equalities
    in many rhythms, but not really a constitutive factor in the rhythm at all? . . . In the end it
    will be much simpler to talk of a rhythm which is actually present . . . the beats of which are
    not fixed in time, while its effect upon us is that of a series of equal time intervals." And
    none of the six theories of meter hitherto advanced (quantitative, accentual, musical,
    stress-verse, centroid, temporal- syllabic) can account for the facts by itself. An adequate
    theory of meter will have to account for everything--duration, intensity, pitch, etc. "The
    empirical facts leave no room for a theory of verse rhythm based merely on time." Cf.

    Dactylic feet are shorter than anapests, trochees shorter than iambs. But a real difference can
    be found between dactylic and anapestic feet, and to a lesser extent between trochaic and
    iambic, in terms of the temporal durations of the constituents of the foot: where a is the
    shortest syllable and c the longest, the dactylic pattern in bac, the anapestic abc. </notes>

   <notes> Calling for a review of the methodological utility and perceptual validity of Liddell's
    six-level stress system and his 86 laws of speech rhythm, Morris formulates three questions as
    criteria for evaluation: "the question of how accurate is his notation of the relative stress. .
    . . the question of the relation of stress to the other four component physical factors, pitch,
    time, tempo, and tone color. . . . and a third question of the relation of normal word-stress to
    sense-stress." Criticizing Liddell's treatment of the third problem and setting aside the
    second, Morris examines the first: four men read then scanned passages of verse; phonetic
    analyses of the readings, along with the scansions, were then compared with Liddell's own
    scansions. All three were very similar, and so the six-level notation is tentatively confirmed
    as perceptually valid. Table of Results. </notes>

   <notes> Along with Snell (E452), Schramm is the principle researcher in Acoustical metrics using
    the kymograph for "objective" measurement of verse. He pays his respects to Lanier and
    Scripture; he notes that accent normally comprises intensity, duration, and pitch increases
    together; he constrasts "speech melody" to musical melody. Chapters on Rime, Rhythm, and the
    Metrical Foot. Though this methodology has not been much admired or followed by later
    prosodists, nevertheless the calm reasonableness of tone here is refreshing and admirable. Short

   <notes> In his later years, however, Scripture turned from phonetics to versification, studying a
    variety of verseforms in both English and German and publishing a considerable number of
    articles on meter and "the melody of speech" (pitch) in verse as he codified and applied his
    theory of versification, which is summarized in the last major work of his life, the
    Grundz|"uge. All of the articles on verse that Scripture published both before and after that
    book are based on its theory, so I cite them below with little commentary. The core of that
    theory is the postulate that the poetic line, based on observed recordings of speech, is a
    continuous soundstream, not segmented into any discrete units called "feet," but rather
    organized by major internal peaks of "energy" (convergences of intensity, loudness, pitch,
    articulation) which group their proclitic and enclitic syllables around themselves to form
    wave-like forms in the soundstream. Scripture refused to admit that syllable- boundaries could
    be identified (though inconsistently he admitted the existence of syllabicity), so no
    segmentation was possible. The result was that he was forced to search for line-types, given his
    view of the line as unit, and though a great many were identified, they could never be reduced
    to a satisfyingly small number of basic types, as in Sievers. But Scripture's work was a
    stimulus to Schramm (E428), whose method seems much more sensible. Other studies by Scripture:

   <notes> Abandoning in part his earlier rejection of the "foot," Scripture finds many choriambi
    (denoted :..: where : represents a strong vowel and . a weak one; alternatively, / x x / ) in
    English verse. But he does so only by terming the running sequence : . . : . . : . . : . . :
    choriambic as well, which seems dubious; traditionally such a sequence would be called dactylic

   <notes> Based on her dissertation at Michigan in 1916. Acoustic-phonetics analysis, via kymograph
    measurement, of the position and length of pauses (N. B.: rhetorical, syntactic, and logical,
    not metrical pauses) in the reading of Paradise Lost by eleven subjects, as compared to their
    readings of lyric verse. Then, measurement of the phrasal units or syntactic groups demarcated
    by the pauses (these average 6.3 syllables and 1.9 sec. in length). Chapter 4 treats the
    questions of "metrical rests" and equal-timed feet, concluding that "when it is possible for a
    foot in a given poem to be five times as long as another in the same poem, and when one foot may
    frequently be twice as long as another, it is obvious that the theory of equality of time cannot
    be maintained, and that the omission of light syllables is not compensated for by pauses."
    Summary of Results at the end. Readers by and large agree on the placement of pauses, of which a
    third more appear within the line than at its end. Interestingly, the word preceding a pause is
    significantly lengthened. </notes>

    Metric," 8 (1913): 104-8; Verrier concludes the exchange in 9 (1914): 385-88. Volume 1 presents
    the theory of Acoustic Metrics, volume 2 the more general theory of rhythm (in prose, song, and
    verse) including a valuable chapter (5) on comparative versification, and volume 3 the kymograph
    experiments on Isochrony. Verrier is the most substantial study of English metrics ever
    undertaken which attempts to apply the assumptions and methods of acoustic phonetics. (It is
    not, however, necessarily the most authoritative; Verrier has been criticized sharply for using
    too few subjects in his tests to guarantee valid results.) He also uses musical notation as
    well, though not systematically. Meter is considered a species of rhythm, and metrical feet,
    which begin with the stressed vowel, are perceptually equal if not objectively so. (In practice
    Verrier takes as equal feet that are unequal by as much as 40%.) In fact, though the whole third
    volume concerns the acoustic experiments, Verrier is finally not committed to objective
    versification; the psychological theories discussed in volume 2 are much closer to his central
    conception of the subjectivity of the perpection of rhythm. Synopsis: "le rythme n'y est
    constitué que par la coincidence de l'accent avec le temps marqué. . . . il est constitué, comme
    celui de la musique, par le retour de temps marqué à intervalles sensiblement égaux." Verrier's
    researches generated the following studies, though see also L988-96. </notes>
