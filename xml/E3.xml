    English courses in schools. Part 3 treats "Metre," giving a simplified, conventional account of
    meters (accent is the basis in English), rhyme, quantity, caesura, and alliteration. Metrical
    Rules: (1) no succession of three syllables without metrical accent; (2) no two consecutive
    syllables in the same word may be metrically accented; (3) metrical accent in polysyllables must
    fall on lternate syllables. See the critique of Abbott's metrical system (both here and in his
    Shakespearean Grammar) in Chapter 3 of Mayor's Chapters on English Metre (E592) and the

    19 (1924): 364-67; in English Studies 8 (1926): 56-58. An introduction to meter on accentual
    principles which was influential in its time. Meter is defined as "rhythm varying over a
    constancy . . . the modulated repetition of a rhythmical pattern." This principle--"rhythmical
    constancy persisting through rhythmical variation," or the variation and the norm--has become a
    central axiom of stress metrics. Yet beyond that point Abercrombie is on a shaky ledge in
    defending the old principles of "equivalence" and "substitution." He can ably distinguish
    metrical base from rhythmic norm, yet he claims that any type of foot may be substituted in the
    rhythm of a blank- verse line for an iamb in the meter because "whatever foot occurs [in the
    rhythm] represents _ _ / standing in place of it when the verse is spaced out in the hearing
    against the ideal pattern," so that any rhythm is perfectly "equivalent" to its metrical base.
    But that is nonsense--no trochaic line fits an iambic base; rhythm is not "equivalent" to meter,
    it corresponds to meter if the rules for correspondence are satisfied. Altogether, the book is
    marred by the lingering influence of Saintsbury, yet it has great fixity of purpose in riveting
    its attention on the theoretical bases of scansion. </notes>

    achievement) in Sewanee Review 37 (1929): 108-14. Abercrombie exerted a modest influence on the
    thinking of the literari in the early decades of the century, and his critical opus shows the
    style of the times-- elegance and generality. See chapters 3 and 5 on rhythm, sound, and meter.
    Stenberg neatly summarizies Abercrombie's view of the emergent vers libre: "Free verse loses
    rather than gains by freeing itself from metrical patterns, for metrical rhythms are continuous,
    whereas free rhythms are not. Metrical rhythm, then, lends a certain unity, as well as a certain
    heightening of emotion, that free verse and prose are not likely to have. Poetry can, however,
    exist without metre." E462 There is a retrospective by Oliver Elton, "Lascelles Abercrombie,
    1881-1938," in Proceedings of the British Academy 25 (1939): 394-421. </notes>

   <notes> In search of a mathemetically absolute Constant through all syllabic Variations, Anderson
    compares the Virgillian hexameter, the French Alexandrine, and the Old English alliterative
    line, finding in them Bases of (respectively) quantity, number, and stress. Each of these three
    qualities is then considered as the possible Constant for modern English verse, but all are
    rejected, as is time. Instead, the Base which underlies all realizations is recognized as a
    "subjective," abstract pattern of repetition of abstract elements [some others would call these
    non-ictus, ictus], such that the pattern for the heroic line is | xa | xa | xa | xa | xa | .
    Verse itself, as a system of abstractions and concretions, may be divided into: (1) "the fixed
    element as predictable, or expected"----the Base (2) "the fixed element as heard" (3) "the
    variable element"----the Modulation </notes>

   <notes> "Metre is the arrangement into verse of definite measures of sounds, definitely accented.
    Thus the hexameter is the arrangement in lines of six equivalent quantities of sound, called
    feet, each of which consists, or has the value, of two long syllables, and is accented on the
    first syllable. . . . In English poetry, length or quantity depends almost entirely upon accent.
    Accented syllables are long, unaccented syllables short." Feet recognized are the iambic,
    trochaic, anapestic, dactylic, spondaic, and amphibrachic. Metrical and stanzaic forms are
    illustrated. Written before Schipper, Arnold's short essay is aware only of Guest (E543); his
    principles are clearly accentual, and we can see here his deliberate (struggling) effort to
    preserve the old classical terminology for the modern verse. </notes>

   <notes> A study narrower in scope and therefore more accessible to most students as an
    introduction to the Russian (i.e. inductive) method in metrics than the monograph by Tarlinskaja
    (E673). Bailey compiles statistics and displays his results in graphic form for stress placement
    and variation, syllabic variation, enjambement and rhyme, lexical selection, and stanza form in
    the iambic tetrameter verse of Jonson, Milton, Pope, Cowper, Blake, Wordsworth, Tennyson, Eliot,
    Auden, and Graves. In respect to rhythm the iambic tetrameter has undergone the greatest changes
    in the twentieth century; it has remained constant in the basic syllabic- and stress-structure
    of the stem of the line, in use of anacrusis, avoidance of contiguous unstressed ictuses, and
    nonmetrical stressing, but substantial changes have occurred in rhythmical variety and average
    stressing, frequency of hiatus and polysyllabic words (higher), and use of elision (lower).
    Bailey has an acute awareness of the uses and abuses of statistical information, and his study
    takes a well-modulated and effective stance between the rocks and the whirlpool, generalization
    and detail. An important direction for metrics in the future. </notes>

    though some musical notation is used. The pentameter consists of five feet, with thirty types of
    variation. He declares himself adverse to strict syllabism, holding that contractions are never

   <bib> Blair, Hugh. Lectures on Rhetoric and Belles-Lettres. 2 vols. London, 1783. </bib>
   <notes> Blair's Rhetoric, which had gone through over 130 editions by the turn of this century,
    offers us an excellent view of the contemporaneous conception of versification on the "lower"
    levels of pedagogy. See Lecture 38 on "Nature on Poetry--Its Origin and
    Progress--Versification," specifically pp. 324-34. Blair recognizes the difference in
    versification between the ancient and the modern languages, so that "mere quantity is of very
    little effect in English versification," and he allows "some liberty for the sake of variety" in
    the placement of accents. The general rule is for five accents and ten syllables in the heroic
    line. A long discussion of caesura-placement shows the influence of Bysshe, and remarks on Blank
    Verse and Couplet Verse conclude the lecture. Lecture 41 (vol. 2) on "The Poetry of the Hebrews"
    is also of interest, as is lecture 13 (vol. 1), "Structure of Sentences--Harmony," esp. p. 259
    ff. The date of the work is not exactly indicative of the true period of influence of these
    ideas since the Lectures were published at the conclusion of Blair's career as Professor of

    Syllabic [i.e. Accentual-Syllabic; Bridges' term is misleading], and Stress Verse. Bridges
    believes that the English accentual-syllabic meter is a descendant of the Medieval Latin system,
    arising out of inattention to the quantities; he identifies the four principles of English verse
    as syllable- counting, alternation of stress, reduction of extra syllables by elision, and
    ignoring of syllabic quantity. Bridges also returns to classical versification throughout the

   <notes> Here he argues that Milton's extra syllables are to be elided for purposes of the meter
    but are to be spoken aloud without reduction, thereby enriching the complication of the verse.
    Even though Bridges' work on the versification of Milton may soon be superceded by Weismiller
    (E1342), his final edition of Milton's Prosody will nonetheless remain a classic. In fact, it
    may be said that the descriptive- analytical approach to metrics so extensively pursued in the
    twentieth century received its impetus chiefly from Bridges. His principles throughout Milton's
    Prosody are three: (1) his method is Inductive; (2) he conceives of the verse- line as
    consisting of a Norm and its Variations; and (3) he considers the verse of Milton to be
    essentially syllabic, and only secondarily accentual. Bridges repeatedly evidences his firm
    grasp of historical phonology, his keen attention to Milton's technic, and his wide reading in
    the history of classical versification. Part I, "On the Prosody of Paradise Lost," treats the
    counting of syllables and accents as the fundamental principles of Miltonic meter; Bridges' view
    of Miltonic elision is that syllables are to be fully realized in pronunciation but elided in
    scansion. The number and placement of accents belongs to the rhythm but not to the meter, since
    for Bridges the accentual structure of Milton's verse is only accessory, "like the flesh on a
    skeleton." He cites lines with three, four, and five accents, with inverted feet in each of the
    five positions, and with line-breaks (he eschews the term "caesura") in each of the nine
    possible positions. Part II, on PR and SA, cites instances of Milton's steady relaxation of the
    rules he followed for PL Part III, "Obsolete Mannerisms," discusses the old conventions for
    "recession of accent," spelling, and pronunciation. The newly-added Part IV, "On the Prosody of
    Accentual Verse," offers remarks on Christabel and seven rules for the prosody of stress verse,
    the joint effect of both of which is that the metrical units or measures in the scansion are to
    be "sometimes determined" by grammar (remember that stress for Bridges is an element of rhythm
    and that sentence-stress in normal speech- rhythm is partially determined by syntax). His
    scansion system marks (in accent) single and double stress and (in quantity) heavy, light, and
    short syllables in combinations producing sixteen varieties of feet. This account will suggest
    that Bridges' mind always remained a little swayed by classical versification, and his typology
    sometimes looks a bit eccentric to us. Yet he insisted on accurate phonetics, his ear was good,
    and his conception of Rules and Norms has had illustrious adherents later in this century. And
    at least one part of Milton's Prosody is entirely beyond cavil--the Preface: delightful wit.
    Discussion of Bridges' work may be found in Prince (E1279), Kellog (E567), Stanford (E86, E87),
    Diekhoff (E1141), and Stall (E664). Note also E689 and E938. </notes>

   <notes> Abstract of a paper read before the Philological Society on June 30: Bright censures the
    notions of "inversion of accent" and "substitution," which "must be corrected by a consideration
    of the secondary word-accents of the language, which are capable of ictus, and of the rhetoric
    of verse, which permits a new emphasis on words of subordinate force. . . . a verse must be
    read, or scanned, with a strict observance of the regular recurrence of the ictus; when the
    ictus is 'in conflict' with the chief word-stress, it will be marked for the ear by a slight
    increase of pitch. . . ." More imaginatively, Bright suggests that Sievers' Five Types may be
    found in modern verse, and also that "the rhythmic employment of the secondary word-stress as
    possible ictus furnishes the means for passing from an 'accentual' to a 'quantitative' system of
    versification," as in early and late Latin. </notes>

    and sentence-stress are both controlled by ictus when words are arrayed in verse. To this end
    Bright must show how "versification in a language is intimately bound up with the special system
    of accentuation of that language," which he performs for English by showing that "secondary
    word-accent is available for verse-stress (ictus)." </notes>

    commonest, in line-lengths up to octameter) and sound- effects, including a chapter (4) on
    Scansion; Part Two illustrates stanza forms from couplet to sestina. Bright, Professor of
    English at Johns Hopkins and President of MLA, exerted considerable influence on the study of
    both versification and Old English early in this century, both himself (see J34, J35) and
    through the studies of his graduate students Huguenin (J133), Melton (E1018), Miller (E596), and
    Brown (E1112), though he himself curiously never undertook a work on the order of Mayor's. The
    crux of Bright's metrical theory is the secondary accent posited between the levels of stressed
    and unstressed in phonology (most conspicuous in compound nouns and other polysyllables) which
    is available in meter as either (promoted to) ictus or (demoted to) non-ictus depending on the
    contiguous stresses. Such a tripartite system was by no means new, but Bright augmented it with
    something that was, his correlate theory of "pitch-accent," a proposal that when the syllable
    under ictus is not marked by stress-prominence (as in "trochaic substitution") a compensating
    prominence by pitch or length is adduced. A further refinement was added by his students, called
    "arsis-thesis variation" (a poet's use of the same word twice, fairly close together, but with
    the stress-pattern of the word reversed the second time for semantic and aesthetic effect). Yet
    Bright's theory is not entirely free from ambivalences: Omond is unquestionably right to declare
    that he "scans wholly by accents," yet he also states that stresses recur at equal intervals,
    and syllable resolution is explained in terms of timing. This is the turn-of-the-century desire
    to have the best of both worlds. But note Philbrick's accusation that Miller and through him
    Bright was guilty of outright plagiarism from Alden and others (D323, pp. 276-77). Still,
    Bright's 3-level system is a significant milestone in the correlation of Phonetic to Metric, to
    be compared with the later 4-level Trager-Smith structural-linguistic system. </notes>

   <notes> The second and third editions were successively revised and expanded, but no substantive

    (Publication no. 40) with an introduction by A. Dwight Culler, Los Angeles, 1953. There is also
    a facsimile of the first edition edited by R. C. Alston, Menston, Yorkshire: Scolar Press, 1968.
    Another reprint: New York: Garland, 1971. Bysshe's is not only the most influential prosodic
    work of the eighteenth century, it is also very likely the most influential prosodic handbook
    ever written. Many times reprinted in the eighteenth century and probably at least skimmed by
    anyone with the slightest literary aspirations at all, it was the major source for Walker's
    equally ubiquitious Rhyming Dictionary of the nineteenth century, a book which was itself the
    model and source for similar works in the twentieth. Hence, a close simulacrum of at least part
    of Bysshe's handbook can be picked up in any bookstore today nearly three centuries later. The
    Art of English Poetry itself was based on (indeed virtually a translation of) Claude Lancelot's
    Quatre Traitez de Poësies, Latine, Françcoise, Italienne, et Espagnole (1663) and on the Preface
    to Joshua Poole's English Parnassus (1657 and 1677; see E520), respectively a treatise in
    comparative versification and a popular handbook of the seventeeth century, and it is composed
    of three parts: the "Rules for Making Verses" (a short metrical treatise), a "Collection of
    Agreeable Thoughts" (a commonplace book, or rough equivalent of our dictionary of familiar
    quotations), and a rhyming dictionary. Now although Renaissance miscellany has its analogue in
    our modern anthology of verse, and the rhyming and quotation dictionary as well as prosodic
    manual are not recognizable sub-genres to us, the "poet's handbook" has not survived in
    unaltered form: in Bysshe's time it occupied a position between those of the modern-day students
    handbook and the technical or theoretical study of versification. In our time technical or
    theoretical study of versification. In our time poets prefer to shift for themselves, finding
    the thought of imitating traditional forms repugnant to their individual talents. Bysshe's
    influence on metrical theory is equally significant. His "Rules," which was the first explicit
    Prosodia written in England in nearly a century, is responsible for reasserting a fundamental
    principle of English meter which had been asserted with equal insistence only once before, in
    the early Middle English period (though even then not by treatise but by practice), syllabism.
    And insofar as any modern manual includes, as part of its definition of English meter,
    stipulation of a certain number of syllables, it is echoing Bysshe, behind him Chaucer, and
    ultimately the faint and distant sounds of the Chansons. Indeed counting of syllables is the
    essential criterion of metricality in Bysshe: the heroic line is for him composed of ten
    syllables (not counting feminine endings), and all lines failing this standard are simply
    unmetrical. "The structure of our Verse . . . consists in a certain Number of Syllables, not in
    Feet compos'd of long and short Syllables. . . ." So runs his first sentence, an opening salvo
    against his nemesis Charles Gildon (E164-165). In order to insure strict count of syllables
    Bysshe is obliged to devise very elaborate rules for elision. After Numbers, the two criteria to
    be observed are "the Seat of the Accent" and "the Pause." Bysshe recognizes accent ("an
    Elevation or a Falling of the Voice," i.e., based on pitch) but not feet; he stipulates only
    that the accent must fall on the 2nd, 4th, or 6th syllable of the decasyllabic line so that the
    caesura ("Pause") will be thereby correctly placed--all other placements are faults to be
    corrected. The "Rules" also give some lesser attention to rhyme and other types of meters and
    stanzas. See the immensely informative essay by Culler (E517), whose scholarship is a model of
    thoroughness, Gabrielson (C10), and Lancelot (L82). </notes>

   <notes> A vigorous statement of the Accentual theory of English metrics, as concise in its texts
    as it is voluminous in footnotes (many of them drawn from the original Latin and Greek). The
    prosody of English verse is posited upon accent not upon time or quantity, there being four laws
    of accentuation: (1) every word of more than one syllable has a "Tonic accent"; it has (2) one
    and only one such accent; (3) monosyllable accent varies with the relative importance of the
    word; and (4) accent rests on the entire syllable not the vowel. Similarly, there are four laws
    of verse: (1) verse-rhythm depends on repetition of accent, which can be (2) nothing other than
    word-accent [lexical stress]; (3) "no syllable not sounded in declaimed prose should be sounded
    in verse"; and (4) hiatus must be removed by elision. The metrical accents falling on the even
    positions of the decasyllabic Heroic line may occur in any of thirty-five possible combinations.
    Conway recognizes what will later be called the Allophonic Stress Principle (p. 30)--i.e., that
    the the second of any two equally stressed syllables dominates. He gives an exceedingly
    meticulous analysis of the metrical treatment of syllables, especially elision; the book ends
    with brief remarks on hypermetrical syllables, rhyme, stanzas, the sonnet, hexameters, and
    sound. In a real sense this dense little volume could be considered an early work in Comparative
    versification, since the Romance languages are treated as a whole, with references to and
    examples from Italian and the classical languages. But English is taken as the unquestionable
    head. Philbrick (D323, pp. 274-76) accuses Conway of plagiarizing from Crowe (E142). </notes>

    incidence of monosyllables, disyllables, and polysyllables in nursery rhymes, Milton, Tennyson,
    Swinburne, Pope, and others. The rationale for this method is that metrics analyzes "units of
    verse-feet," and that we must similarly analyze "the basic phonetic units of speech--i.e.,
    phonetic word-forms" in order to possess concrete information for the study of "one of the
    fundamental problems of verse as a whole, the relation of the word to the foot." Thereafter, the
    author works to produce a "consistent theory of English verse-structure as a whole" by reviewing
    the metrical theory of the time (Saintsbuty, Omond, Bridges, and others), followed by remarks on
    the problem of "secondary accent." The author, a poet, died in 1914. I must confess to finding

   <bib> Culler, A. Dwight. "Edward Bysshe and the Poet's Handbook." PMLA 63 (1948): 858-85. </bib>
   <notes> Based on his dissertation work at Yale in 1941, "Handbooks for Poets in the Eighteenth
    Century." With immense erudition Culler traces the sources, nature, and influences of Bysshe's
    enormously influential handbook (E506); indeed, it is not too much to say that Bysshe is the
    most important prosodic work produced between 1589 (Puttenham) and 1775 (Steele). Culler shows
    convincingly that Bysshe was heavily indebted to Joshua Poole's work (E520), and also that
    virtually every other poetic handbook, grammar, dictionary, rhyming dictionary, and commonplace
    book of the eighteenth century is derived, usually nearly entirely, from Bysshe. And through
    Walker's later rhyming dictionary, which also is Bysshe's progeny, he remained a standard source
    well into the twentieth century. If we remember that Bysshe meant his book as a reference and a
    handbook, not a prosodical treatise, we can obtain a rare glimpse of what the poets of the age
    took as an authority on versification, as opposed to the pronouncements of the scholars, the two
    being scarecely reconcilable at best. In terms of prosodic theory, however, Bysshe's influence
    was wholly pernicious, and quite extended. His system is entirely syllabic, basing meter on
    count of syllables instead of accents or feet. He obtained this system by lifting it wholesale
    from Claude Lancelot's 1663 French Treatise Quatre Traitiz de Poësies Latine, Françciose,
    Italienne, et Espagnole. Thus Bysshe simply attempted to force-fit the template of Romance
    prosody onto the English language, ignoring the fact that it did not--never could--fit, thereby
    perpetrating a misconception that would hold sway until the Romantic era (esp. Christabel). The
    Classical system would not fit the verse native to England, nor would the French, even though
    Bysshe could make men believe it for nearly a century. </notes>

    27 (1966): 177A (Washington). </bib>
   <notes> In contrast to all the other metrical theories of this century, Cummings' system
    conflates meter and rhythm rather than distinguishing them. In chapters 1 and 2 here a system
    for analyzing "rhythm phrases" is given which combines traditional metrics with acoustic
    phonetics under the aegis of a Gestalt theory of reader perception. The practical results are
    that in his scansions (model on p. 22; diagram of method on p. 14) he refuses to let the
    metrical divisions cut through words; he can provide no clearcut rules for scansion, and no
    discerning consistency is evident in the analysis. But in chapters 3-5 he maps out three new
    types of analysis which are sophisticated and intriguing: "extrinsic stress" analysis combines a
    marking of the phrase-boundaries with Trager-Smith stress levels, adjusted by "weighting," to
    produce Stress Contour graphs and concomitant Transitional Features charts; "intrinsic stress"
    analysis argues that primary stresses are no more equal than syllables are in general, and if we
    establish "intrinsic vowel scales" assigning a weight to each vowel in terms of stress, pitch,
    and duration in each consonantal environment, an improved Stress Contour results; analysis of
    sound patterning can be improved if vowels and consonants are grouped by phonetic families in a
    "fusion" analysis which will reveal asymmetrical (ground) and symmetrical (figure) repetition as
    well as heightening and muting of the meter in verse-lines by clustering and linking of sounds.

   <notes> "The perception of metrical effects depends on set expectations in the mind of a reader.
    These expectations provide . . . a norm, a predisposition toward a certain patterning." A
    Gestalt approach based on the premise that the experienced reader of English poetry "tries to
    perceive a segmentation into units corresponding to iambic feet" (italics added). The authors
    argue, that is, that there is a pressure in English poetry for the reader to perceive the iambic
    line not as pairs of syllables grouped accentually, but simply segmentally--by "phrasal
    segmentation after each strong stress"--the simple grouping of pairs of syllables. "The English
    iambic tradition rests upon more than the iambic accentuation normally seen as characteristic of
    it; it rests, too, on a norm of iambic segmentation." These segments, which are "the basic
    rhythmic units in English metrical verse." the authors term rhythm-phrases; they serve to
    resolve "the demands exerted by the grammatical, the rhetorical, and the metrical norms." The
    authors explore the problems of diaeresis, without terming it so, and discuss various
    segmentations which try to resolve the conflicting pressures in various lines. The whole
    argument is ingeniously simple and intriguing even though it clearly borders on circularity.

    rhymes, rich rhymes, long polysyllables, and empty epithets (mere fillers). We are told that
    "harmony, in prose, consists in an exact placing of the accent. . . . in poesie, it consists
    besides the aforesaid conditions of prose in measure, proportion, and Rhime." It seems very
    unlikely that the author of this rather simpleminded preface was the young Dryden. </notes>

   <notes> Daniel's reply to Campion's Observations (E134) defending the native versification would
    have swept the field even if Campion's advocacy of the classical meters had been timely and
    persuasive (instead of a decade too late). With remarkable vigor D. sets about the construction
    and application of an unmatchable engine of assault, binding plain act and force of argument
    with engaging eloquence: "All verse is but a frame of wordes confinde within certaine measure .
    . . which frame of wordes consisting of Rithmus or Metrum, Number or Measure." And in English
    "accent [is] the chief Lord and graue Gouernour of Numbers." It were outright folly to apply the
    laws of one language to the verse of another; "every language hath her proper number or measure
    fitted to vse and delight," enforced and given legitimacy by "both Custom and Nature." (Besides,
    "it is but a fantastike giddinesse to forsake the way of other men.") "For as Greeke and Latine
    verse consists of the number and quantitie of sillables, so doth the English verse of measure
    and accent. . . . so that the English verse then hath number, measure, and harmonie in the best
    proportion of Musike." Daniel is even willing to admit that the continual reappearance of rhyme
    in the couplet is tiresome (his suggested remedy is emjambement, which he thinks "graceful"),
    yet he denies, adamantly, that Rhyme is too flimsy a support for verse (it "hath more of delight
    than euer bare numbers," since its "known frame hath those due staies for the minde, those
    incounters of touch as makes the motion certaine, though the varietie be infinite"), or that the
    necessity of finding rhymes is any "impediment to [the poet's] conceit." Finally, he will not
    flinch to face Campion directly: "For what a doe haue we heere, what strange precepts of an Arte
    about the framing of an Iambique verse in our language, which when allis done, reaches not by a
    foote, but falleth out to be the plaine ancient verse consisting of tenne sillables or fiue
    feete, which hat euer beene vsed amongst vs time out of minde. . . . So that of all these eight
    seuerall kindes of new promised numbers [Campion's] you see what we haue. Onely what was our

   <notes> Among the various efforts of its century, this book rests with a greater weight than most

    peculiarly marked" by duration, tone, or emphasis in pronunciation; each of these latter has
    been used at some time, though stress "is the only basis of versification in every modern
    language." Chapters follow on Quantity and Stress, six chapters on the (non- metrical) Pause,
    and, late, two chapters on the Hexameter. The book is actually, though, a study in conparative
    versification, since Evans' emphasis (along with his examples) falls equally on the Ancient and

    pp. 141-77. </bib>
   <notes> Fowler's metatheoretical inquiry into the components of an adequate theory of English
    meter appropriates Jakobson's pair of conceptual couples--verse design, verse-instance;
    delivery-design, delivery-instance--and adds one more, verse-type and metrical set, producing an
    ordered hierarchy: (verse) verse type verse design metrical set delivery design verse instance
    delivery instance (It will be seen that metrical set and verse instance thus correspond to
    reading design and reading instance, though Fowler does not make this explicit.) Each level of
    the heirarchy is then discussed in detail. "Verse is language with additional formal
    constraints." Verse-type is determined by the feature relevant to the verse--stress, quantity,
    or tone. Verse design is the inflexible pattern (e.g., iambic pentameter) set as invariant for
    the poem as a whole; actual variations (e.g. "trochaic substitutions") occur at the level of
    verse instance and "must not be spuriously reified" (this is a crucial nexus in the theory).
    Metrical set is "a reader's disposition, through past experience and through design- signals in
    the poem, to impose a familiar reading on any metre which does not absolutely forbid it."
    Thereafter the bulk of the essay tackles the critical and delicate problem of verse instance,
    Fowler giving a detailed account of that "whole area of descriptive metrics" whose
    responsibility is to show how a reader, operating under regular phonological and syntactic
    rules, (four such rules are given), determines which syllables in a line are ictic, whether or
    not the line is regular in number of syllables (Fowler thinks the theory of elision unlikely and
    prefers to admit extra-metrical syllables), and whether the number and positions of the
    syllables are acceptable (iambic pentameters frequently fail of five stresses, and reversed feet
    do occur). Actually "the ontology of verse instance remains uncertain," but since it partakes of
    both the objective linguistic features of the line, and also the reader's predisposed metrical
    set, the perfect pattern of the design need never be realized anywhere at all in a poem for it
    to be perceived as in that design. Fowler takes the position that even lines identical in
    syllable- count and stress-pattern are different verse instances, since their linguistic
    textures are different in many other respects. Concluding remarks on delivery. All this amounts
    to a theory of meter, as Fowler admits at the end. An advanced study, very dense in import and
    rather stiff in tone; not for students. The essay thoroughly substantiates its opening
    observation: "the verse situation is extremely complex." </notes>

   <notes> The most widely disseminated student's manual of metrics available at present, the intent
    of which is not so much typological as heuristic: Fussell aims to "sensitize" students to the
    supple flexes of poetic form. But, as paradign of the perfect American consumer, he is more than
    willing to trade in precision for style, so that what this book gains in urbanity it more than
    loses in rigor. Fussell allows up to seventeen types of feet, and his scansions are
    consistently, sometimes wildly, unreliable. His theory in general is almost purely
    expressionist, even though none of the explanations of metrical effect he lists in chapter 1 is
    seriously maintained by anyone anymore. Worse, he can sometimes say the most embarrassing
    things: substitutions in meter "are governed by instinct, whim or taste rather than by rule";
    Old English meter has only a limited capacity for interplay"; the volta in a sonnet "occurs
    somewhere in the white space that separates line 8 from line 9." We should expect as much from
    anyone whose theory is that "to do something to the reader is the end of poetry." Metrical types
    are enumerated in chapter 3, stanzas in chapter 7. The revised edition alters a few judgments,
    prunes the Bibliography, and adds a chapter on Free Verse, which is also separately published
    (E1473). Whatever the beginning student might learn here about "sensitivity" cannot be valued
    over his learning a fundamentally licentious method; send him instead to Malof (E581) for
    information on forms, McAuley (E578) for scansion- technique, and Smith (B202) and Booth (B20)

    Sections 25-28 treat "Accent," "Metre," "Accented Rhymed Verse," and "Of Poetry Composed in

    syllable, of a foot, of metre properly speaking, and of poetry," "quantity" is used only to
    satisfy the adamant Latinists, since "every syllable which has an acute or circumflex accent is
    long," based on the premise that "our prosody should not be yoked to the rules of Greek or
    Latin, but should be measured by the yardstick of our own rules alone." Gill produces elaborate
    rules for determining "quantity" from accent. Though he will admit rhyme in English verse, he
    allows it only grudgingly, citing numerous other devices necessary to "moderate" the "nausea or
    wearying" of a too-frequent use. Metrical feet acknowledged for English: spondee, trochee, iamb,

    separated from the rhythm of verse. Indeed, Grew gives the fullest collection of apposite
    examples of rhythmic "Phrasing" against the metrical "Abstract Pattern" that I have seen; his
    only failing is that he insists on keeping the old and misleading terms (monosyllabic foot, weak
    foot, spondee, pyrrhic, ionic, paeonic, inversion, substitution, equivalence) as denoting
    variations in the meter, but these are in fact variations in the rhythm against the metrical

    ed. edited by W. W. Skeat in one volume. London: George Bell and Sons, 1882. </bib>
   <notes> Rev: in The Gentleman's Magazine for June 1838; The Athenaeum, 1838, p. 551. See the
    critiques by Mayor (E594) and Jenkin (E299), and see E918. Under the influence of the early
    nineteenth-century revival of interest in Anglo-Saxon, Guest was encouraged to apply the
    principles of Old English verseform to the modern languages as well. The result, though
    fundamentally misconceived, is nevertheless a great early milestone in the history of English
    metrics. Against the general opinion of his time, Guest insisted that the basis of English meter
    was the succession of accents and not of time. By profession he was a philologist, not a
    literary critic, and indeed, in order to gather quotations for the first edition of this book,
    Guest was forced to copy out the great majority by hand from the original MSS themselves, there
    being no standard texts in 1838. Skeat, then, was forced to search out and verify these
    thousands of passages for the second edition. Guest's specialty, moreover, was Old and Middle
    English, a fact which insured that not only would the historical focus of the book be
    overweighted on the earliest times in our poetry, but also that he would draw his principles and
    methodology from the analogy with the Anglo-Saxon system. Thus, Guest identifies not "feet" but
    "sections" of syllable-groups as the basis of meter. He identifies twelve types of these
    sections, each type having three variants, Normal, Lengthened, and Doubly Lengthened. In Skeat's
    notation, where the capital A stands for an accented syllable and the lower-case b stands for an
    unaccented syllable, these twelve types of sections (hence rhythm-units) are: 1. AbA. 1l. AbAb.
    1ll. AbAbb. 5. bAbA. 5l. bAbAb. 5ll. bAbAbb. 9. 9l. 9ll. bbAbA. bbAbAb. bbAbAbb. 2. AbbA. 2l.
    AbbAb. 2ll. AbbAbb. 6. bAbbA. 6l. bAbbAb. 6ll. bAbbAbb. 10. bbAbbA. 10l. bbAbbAb. 10ll.
    bbAbbAbb. 3. AbAbbA. 3l. AbAbbAb. 3ll. AbAbbAbb. 7. bAbAbbA. 7l. bAbAbbAb. 7ll. bAbAbbAbb. 11.
    bbAbAbbA. 11l. bbAbAbbAb. 11ll. bbAbAbbAbb. 4. AbbAbbA. 4l. AbbAbbAb. 4ll. AbbAbbAbb. 8.
    bAbbAbbA. 8l. bAbbAbbAb. 8ll. bAbbAbbAbb. 12. bbAbbAbbA. 12l. bbAbbAbbAb. 12ll. bbAbbAbbAbb.
    Each type may be expanded (or replicated internally) so long as its nature is preserved; type 5
    may be either bAbA or bAbAbA or bAbAbAbA, etc. Guest also uses the colon to denote a caesura in
    the line, and an upright bar (|) to mark a preceding syllable as stressed. Thus Milton's
    "Anguish and doubt and fear, and sorrow and pain" may be scanned An| guish and doubt| and fear|
    : and sor| row and pain| and conveniently notated as 2:5. Structurally, the History of English
    Rhythms is divided into four Books: the first defines syllable, accent, quantity, rime, and
    pause; the second gives illustrations of each of the twelve rhythmic types, the third is a
    history of stanza forms. In many respects not even Saintsbury's three-volume History (A8) can
    rival the erudition, clarity, industry, and graceful tone of Guest's treatise, and though his
    system seems to us an odd one, it is easy to learn and use. As Henry James said in another
    place, the book "supports familiarity"; it will not weary the reader soon, as Saintsbury will.
    Though Guest's direct influence has been slight in the century after his work was first
    published, his Accentualist principles have pretty much won the field. Guest's system has been
    applied only by T. R. Price (E1278), however. </notes>

    The accentual basis of meter is clearly separated from the rhythm of equal time-periods. Along
    with that of Gayley and Scott (L46), Gummere's work was the most influential in America around

    "emphatic stress" (emphasis resulting from accent). The rhythm of verse he considers to be based
    on both (i.e., the metrical ictus can be fulfilled sometimes by one, sometimes by the other, or
    both together). English meter has no predominant base-foot, he thinks, but is much more diverse
    than we usually believe; e.g., the first line of Paradise Lost actually comprises an iamb,
    monosyllabic foot, trochee, dactyl, and an anapest. </notes>

   <bib> Halpern, Martin. "On the Two Chief Metrical Modes in English." PMLA 77 (1962): 177-86. </bib>
   <notes> In a brilliant codification of the traditional concepts of English meter, Halpern shows
    that a more compelling distinction than that between stress meter and syllable-stress meter in
    English is the one between "the entire iambic tradition and all English verse written in
    strong-stress meter, whether syllable-counting or not." In iambic verse the important
    differences of stress between syllables are relative, within the two-member metrical foot (this
    is the Relative Stress Principle), whereas in all the other meters the differences are absolute.
    (I.e., in iambic verse, metrical foot demarcation precedes metrical stress assignment, whereas
    in the other meters metrical stress assignment follows directly from the linguistic stresses:
    the strong are strong and the weak weak). This explains our comon sensation that the beats in
    trochaic in the ternary meters are so "clear and emphatic" in comparison with the unstressed
    syllables, while they are not so in iambic meter: in iambic verse the gradations are modulated.
    The trochaic the ternary meters, like simple stress verse, are isoaccentual and isochronic
    (iambic verse is neither), but unlike stress verse, which achieves some modulation by varying
    the number of syllables, these meters, having a regular syllable-count, lose modulation
    altogether, which explains why we cannot bear them for extended runs. In iambic verse the only
    permissible variations are the addition or deletion of a syllable or reversal of a foot.

    base, with some twelve other feet admissible as modulations: stressed and unstressed
    monosyllabic feet, major and minor ionics, pyrrhics and spondees, choriambics, tribrachs,

    a summary on pp. 77-79, and Herbert gives his own view of English versification on pp. 65-71.
    The essay opens with a long discussion of Greek and English phonetics and Greek popular
    accentual poetry. Herbert argues that Greek speech and verse had tonic (stress) accents as well
    as quantity and that English stress does not lengthen a syllable (contrary to Foster, Sheridan,
    and Kames). On the modern accentual hexameters he observes keenly that since classical verse had
    both accent and quantity, to replace the one by the other is not to reproduce or even achieve an
    analogous effect but to confound, conflate, and wreck the original meter. The modern Romance
    meters were "not modern inventions, but the old accentual laws of Latin verse, which survived
    those of quantity." English meter is based on "accentual feet," one stress to the foot, but
    quantity "neither is, not ought to be entirely disregarded"; in fact, since many links have
    seven, eight, or nine long syllables, "variety of quantity is rather to be sought for than
    restricted." </notes>

   <notes> Omond did not see this work, which, for its rather insular position, shows some
    unexpected perception. Humphrey identifies the qualities of sound in orthoepy (pronunciation) as
    accent ("stress of voice"), cadence (absence of stress), emphasis (rhetorical or sentential
    stress), tone (intonation, pitch), time, and quantity. Quantity is "the weight, or aggregate
    quantum of sounds, either longer or shorter" and thereby "differs materially from time: time
    only determines the length of sounds." Though these are two distinct entities, they both inhere
    in verse-structure; "they are both affected by accent and cadence, but quantity more than time,
    and quantity more than time also constitutes numbers." Humphrey realizes that though time was
    the origin for quantity in ancient Greek verse, quantity is in essence an abstract concept, and
    though it was called long and short in Greek, it would be more accurately termed "great and
    small quantity" in English. In short, he recognizes the hegemony of accent, even though the old
    terms are preserved. Twelve types of feet are allowed, five of them denoted as commonest. Rules
    for scansion and also for reading are given. The remainder of this little book treats stanzaic
    forms. </notes>

   <notes> Written by the King when he was only eighteen, this treatise on the writing of native

    long, short, or indifferent) without any deeper inquiry, and the only indication that he takes
    accent to determine quantity--and hence confounds accent with quantity--appears early on, when
    the versifier is enjoined to "ryme ay to the hinmest lang syllable (with accent) in the lyne" as
    in "byte and flyte, because the lenth of the syllable, and accent being there." None of his
    quantities violates accent. The rules for rhyme, sectioun (caesura), fitting of the words into
    the meter, stanzas, comparisons, and Inventions are all familiar enough; of interest are his

    half a century ahead of their time. He attacks the "permissible substitutions" or "variations
    against the norm" theory of meter, showing it does not explain the facts. He rejects the idea of
    the metrical foot and of only two degrees--Stressed or Weak--in English meter, preferring
    himself four degrees of metrical stress. He asserts the Relative Stress Principle--the
    metrically relevant differences in stress are only relative not absolute. He acknowledges the
    Pause as metrically important and devises an entirely new scansion system to show the rises and
    falls between syllables in the [pentameter] line: a / b \ a / b \ a / b \ a / b \ a / b From our

    into verse-structure is ordered on the consideration of number, quantity, and arrangement of
    syllables, pause, (caesura-placement receives a very long treatment), and accent. He identifies
    four types of the heroic line (by the caesura after the fourth, fifth, sixth, or seventh
    syllable) but at the end comes finally to prefer Miltonic blank verse. Though the substance in

    confirms, in opposition to the Saintsbury heresy, "trisyllabic substitution." The syllabic
    metrical theory at the center of Milton's practice, as described by Bridges, is nearly identical
    to that set forth in the verse-manuals of the Italian Renaissance (e.g. Minturno's), which were
    themselves descriptions of the syllabic meters of such poets as Trissino. These four
    writers--two poets, two prosodists--represent the four most crucial figures in a metrical

    that "the present meaning of the word accent bears no relation to its original use." In
    classical times speech was "a kind of song," but we have lost this "chaunt of accent" (i.e.,
    tone). In classical verse, accent and quantity did not coincide; neither do they in modern
    verse. Stress "supplies the place of" length for us. The term "feet" he rejects in favor of

   <bib> La Drière, J. Craig. "Prosodic Notation." Princeton (A18), pp. 667-69. </bib>
   <notes> Identifying three possible notation systems for marking the suprasegmental features of
    speech (by diacritical markings; by complete graphic transcription, either phonetic or phonemic;
    or by an "abstract schematic symbolism"), La Drière supports the third system as being
    value-free, applicable to all languages, and restricted to the rhythmic features of interest.
    Various sorts have been tried, using as symbols (1) letters of the alphabet (Verrier, Stewart),
    (2) numbers, to mark intensity or position or both (Mayor, Lotz, Croll), (3) musical notation
    (Gildon, Lanier), or (4) arbitrary graphic markers (Steele, Skeat, Thomson, Heusler, and La
    Drière himself). The author's own system, employed in the following article, is explained: the
    syllable is abstractly symbolized as o, with diacritical marks for four degrees of stress and
    hovering stress, the comma for breaks between stress-groups, and the subscript caret for longer
    pauses. Marks for primary, secondary, tertiary, and weak accent (respectively): ó ò o oo.
    Hovering primary-secondary uses a hacek over the o. La Drière's system also differentiates group
    cadence [the rhythmic or phrasal groups of stresses determined by syntax], general cadence
    [meter, in effect], and measure [balance within the line and equalization between lines]. This
    system will also be found employed in the subsequent studies by Barry (E1448), Dougherty (D272),
    Holloway (E914), and Berg (E950). A more conventional scansion system is described in Princeton
    s.v. "Scansion," pp. 740-41. </notes>

    indices of a poetic style is the interwoven pattern of meter and syntax, since "in metrical

    or less useful. The meter of a poem must be found by the norm of the entire poem, not by
    inductively categorizing all the line-types--that is not a meter. As for scansion, musical

   <notes> Rev: in Southern Review 3 (1967): 441-43; see also Pyle (E618). Chapter 1 presents the
    basic concepts of Meter: the fundamental unit of versification is the line; the metrical foot
    consists of a cluster of slacks around a single stress; monosyllabic feet are possible,
    therefore, but not pyrrhics or spondees; and speech-stresses vary in degree but are reduced to
    only two levels in meter. Chapter 2 treats Variation: substitution and elision, changes of line-
    length, and changes of meter. But it is the crucial Chapter 3 where the author reveals his
    excellent design for "exhibiting the essential duality of our experience of the line" by a
    double-tiered scansion system; but showing the actual rhythm above the paradigmatic meter, he
    can display cogently all the subtle effects of each against the other and the resultant scansion
    of the line. Chapter 4 treats the influence of meter on performance; 5, sound-patterning; 6,
    Accentual, Syllabic, and Free meters; followed by a Glossary. McAuley's handbook is easily the
    best text available for teaching metrics, and beyond that is one of the sanest things ever

    rhythm--and the resultant "interanimations" of the two--better displayed. </notes>

   <notes> More useful than the conception of meter as an abstract form--i.e., as container, or else
    one element contained--is the conception of meter as organic form, as a force for order within
    "a coherence of activities," "a system of dynamics," the poem. Within that dynamos energy is
    balanced against tension, so that the poem moves by "an accommodation of movement to the
    resistances against it," the antinomian forces generating "form" by their constructive and
    vitalic oppositions. Over all of these stands the impassive Meter, making its subtle Authority
    manifest only through the body of the lines, creating an immanent fixity and stricture of rule
    which is the paradoxical source of a nearly infinite range of variation. Throughout every supple
    or sudden divagation, underneath every gesture of hand or voice, nearly behind the field of view
    in every image, the form of the poem speaks Constancy, promises Order, satisfies Expectation,
    indeed nearly convinces us that all is for the best and that the poet is really very sane.

    (1964): 580-94. </bib>
   <notes> A remarkable effort at synthesizing the entire history of English metrics into a single
    cogent interpretation that can be demonstrated within a very small compass: Malof's thesis is
    that the native English verseform, the old four-stress line, and the more complex foreign form,
    the (syllable-counting) pentameter line, have developed side by side, neither one very far from
    the other, throughout the entire history of English poetry: "the old native rhythm runs through
    much of our pentamenter verse, providing a basis for a continual modulation of counterpoint."
    Indeed, what one may say of the Romantic revolution and of the verse of the twentieth ventury,
    as of the late Shakespeare, is that the foreign verseform may "take over momentarily and
    denaturalize the native line, but that in time the native element reasserts itself and
    renaturalizes the line, transforming the foreign element into something new as it does so." In
    any period of crisis or uncertainty the sturdier native form will resurface. There is, then, a
    fundamental ambiguity between stress verse and foot verse; they permeate each other yet seem
    somewhat immiscible, so that much English verse more or less qualifies as either; the great
    success of our poetry has been to hold them both in solution together, productively. </notes>

   <notes> Mason intends to scan by quantity, as he constructs verse of "time, syllables, feet, and

    unaccented syllable is naturally Short, he says, "yet if it be Accented in the Ordinary Way of
    Pronunciation, or the Sense requires the Emphasis to be laid on it, it becomes a long Quantity."
    He recognizes four disyllabic feet, eight trisyllabic, and sixteen tetrasyllabic, These last are
    formed of combinations of the disyllabic types and called "Dipodies"; whenever the two simple
    feet are dissimilar, they are termed a "Syzygy." More interesting historically, though, is the
    conjunction of poetic measure and music made in chapters 7 and 8. It is fair to say that Mason

   <notes> A good many of us could go to school here: Maxwell's thesis is metrical
    counterpoint--that effect wherein "every reader of poetry is quite well aware of two movements,
    the first a pattern borne in mind, the second a speech movement which, whether in identity or
    variation, is related to it, though a momentary forgetfulness of the relationship is possible
    and sometimes pleasing." His point, more specifically though, is "a clear distinction between
    the sort of feet which may compose the basic pattern [the meter] and those which may be
    introduced by way of variation [in speech]. The second sort may be made up in almost any way"
    [italics added]. Thus each syllable of Tennyson's line "Break, break, break" is a foot in the
    second system but not in the first. "The principle to be observed is that the basic pattern must
    always determine the number of metrical divisions" rather than the actualized variations. The
    reader of verse, then, feels "the need to follow two movements at once," yet surprisingly the
    effort produces not an added difficulty, but "a curious grace." That is the pleasure we take in
    the lines of accomplished actors. </notes>

   <notes> Rev: By Gummere in MLN 2 (1887): 159-62. One of the lesser-known monuments of late
    Victorian metrics, but likely second only to Schipper (A9) in scope, method, and significance.
    Saintsbury said that "had Mr. J. B. Mayor's Chapters on English Metre been fuller, I had hardly
    written this book. . . . an unsound criticism is rare, an unsound scansion rarer."
    Unfortunately, though, Mayor compiled the book not by writing out his views on metrics directly
    but by collecting five essays he had previously published reviewing the major metrists who had
    preceded him--Guest, Abbott, Symonds, Ellis, Bridges, and Skeat (chapters 2, 3, 4, 5, and 7 of
    Chapters respectively), four essays on the history of Blank Verse (chs. 10-13), an essay on
    Shelley's meters (see E1017), and a chapter on the Hexameter, adding for the book publication
    only an Introduction, two Appendices, (the first on the Old French decasyllable, with an
    abstract of Zarncke's obscure monograph (L658), the second listing the terminology of classical
    versification), and two new essays on metrical classification (chapters 8 and 9). Thus we are
    forced to find Mayor out by indirections, watching his theory unfold in his reactions to the
    critical minds around him. That theory scans verse entirely by accent (Mayor thinks the concept
    of quantity very nearly ludicrous) but views the line as comprising metrical feet, not merely
    syllables. This position, the stress-and-foot theory, has become virtually High Orthodox in the
    century since Mayor's book. He is willing to retain the classical nomenclature (for
    convenience's sake), but oddly, he seems to think that the function of the metrist is to
    discover and categorize all the variations on strictly regular meter that are to be found in a
    poet's lines--ascending or descending, disyllabic or trisyllabic, truncated, hypermetrical, or
    downright irregular. In retrospect, that function seems necessary as a preliminary to the
    interpretation and criticism but worse than pedantic as an end. Mayor recognizes three degrees
    of stress, and he uses the 0, 2, 3 system of Ellis (C9) to mark them in scansions. Halpern
    (E546) believes that Mayor recognized the Relative Stress Principle in the 1870's, nearly thirty
    years before Jesperson. On Guest, Mayor demonstrates in too painful detail the easy recognition
    that his system is entirely perverse: to believe that the Old English prosody of "sections"
    (halflines) is the authentic metric of all English poetry up to the present is indeed to find
    that by such a system all the best modern poets have been bunglers and gross incompetents. So
    Guest's system, ponderously cumbersome, misrepresents those lines that it does not
    misunderstand. The accent-based metric of Edwin Abbott (E458) Mayor thinks the "true and
    natural" approach, though his distinction of word-accent, metrical- accent, and emphasis creates
    some needlessly complicated rules for assigning metrical ictus. Mayor argues for pyrrhics and
    spondees. In the case of A. J. Ellis's system, however, the complications are compounded beyond
    all reason. Hoping to avoid the very nebulous terms "accent" and "emphasis," Ellis distinguishes
    between force, length, pitch, weight, and silence in syllables, allowing a scale of nine degrees
    of gradation for each feature, each of the degress having an individual descriptive term--e.g.
    "superheavy," "sublong," "supershort"--producing, thus, forty-five terms altogether. Mayor can
    only "with difficulty repress a shudder at the elaborate apparatus he has provided for
    registering the minutest variations of metrical stress." The concept of weight is also
    questionable. Three other theorists are reviewed: Symonds (E1320) is censured for the
    dilettantism of his "intuitivism"; Bridges is judged by setting his theory of stress meter in
    Milton (E491) against his own work in The Feast of Bacchus and Nero, where its neglect of
    syllable-counting results in ineffective description (notice that Mayor's concern with
    syllable-counting, though, leads him in chapter 9 to a total misunderstanding of Hymn Meters);
    and Skeat (E646) is found confused and unnatural, his groupings of syllables around an accent
    more a matter of rhythm than of meter. Chapter 6, however, deserves final attention: there Mayor
    elaborates his method--which is, simply put, Empiricisim--in an attempt to arbitrate alternative
    scansions of problem lines. Two principles emerge: the prevailing context will control our
    scanning of any given line, and in general the range of permissible variations for a meter can
    be stated. But this sort of statement (p. 91) turns out to be rather unpleasantly extended and
    qualified, allowing only a cautious general rules: "one or two unaccented syllables preceding
    the initial accent or following the final accent of the line are non-essential to the rhythm."
    Such a result must surely cast doubt over the utility if not the validity of the method.

   <notes> Rev: in the Critical Review 38 (1774): 137-43; by Herbert in the Edinburgh Review (see
    E550). Quite possibly our earliest English effort at a comparative versification for the modern
    languages as well as for the ancient. I treat the second edition here; the 1774 Essay was
    directed against Foster, but the Inquiry retracts a bit in favor of more general principles. For
    Mitford, harmony in language is the result of the combination of measure and melody. Accent or
    Tone he considers the result of both force (loudness, in three degrees) and higher pitch.
    "Emphasis" is rhetorical accent. Syllabic quantity is recognized--in regard to both long and
    short vowels and long and short syllables--as is length by position: a short vowel followed by
    two distinct consonants makes the syllable long. But Mitford is careful not to confound accent
    and quantity: stress does not lengthen syllables. The "rhythmus or cadence" of English speech is
    compared to music, but even though he can speak of "the identity of poetical and musical
    measures," in general he considers the relation of verse to music to be one of analogy. Verse,
    like music, runs in either common or triple time, the beats beginning the bars and hence
    disposed isochronously in relation to each other. Yet when Mitford comes to scansions, no
    musical apparatus is anywhere in sight: the accents end the iambic measures rather than begin
    them, and though quantities are marked throughout (virtually all syllables turn out to be long,
    of course), they clearly have no relation to the stressing. He recognizes that the
    irregularities of syllabic quantity are such that "the disposition of long and short quantities
    cannot be the foundation of that order which constitutes the order of verse." And "as the
    arrangement of music in bars has been decided by the convenience of the musical performer
    without any consideration of the competition of music with poetry, so the arrangement of the
    syllables in verse in feet should be decided by the convenience of metrical analysis, without
    regard to those divisions which music has established for its own separate purposes." In short,
    Mitford scans by accent alone, regardless of the theoretical genuflections he makes to the
    musical ideas of the day. (Elsewhere he calls accent "not the constituent but the indicant only
    of measure.") That order which does constitute the verse in English is one wherein "the
    alternate syllables are acuted." Permissible "aberrations of accent" include the doubling,
    absence, and reversal of the stress in the foot, and extra syllables are to be admitted as
    trisyllabic substitutions rather than removed as elisions (perspicuously, Mitford sees that "the
    poetical or metrical syllable is not precisely the same with the grammatical syllable" in some
    cases). Section 3 treats Quantity, 4 Accent, and 5 Cadence. Section 6 offers his theory of the
    mechanism of English verse. Section 7 on the history of English versification is also of
    interest. Summary (curious and interesting), pp. 108-9. Mitford is a landmark in the history of
    English versification. (Fussell's treatment of Mitford (E34) is inconsistent and confused; he
    finds there both strict syllabism and "anti-syllabism" (pp. 33 and 150).) </notes>

   <notes> See chapters 4-6 of Book 2, and chapter 8 of Book 3, in volume 2. Monboddo's tediously
    repetitive treatise shows the great promise of a rigorous distinction between quantity and
    accent, until one recognizes that by "accent" he means pitch, not stress--an "acute or grave"
    quality of the voice, as opposed to "loud or soft" or "long or short." The Classical Greek
    language he holds to have been regulated by this "accent," not quantity--"the antient accents
    are real notes of music, or variations of the tone, by which the voice is raised higher. . . ."
    Such "accents" he denies exist in modern English (p. 298 ff); we have changes of tone, well
    enough, "but upon words or sentences . . . not upon syllables," and they admit of no rule. Thus
    Monboddo can back into the truth: "in English, syllabical accents . . . are of a quite different
    kind from the antient accents; for there is no change of the tone in them; but the voice is only
    raised more, so as to be louder upon one syllable than another. . . . the music of our language
    [is] in this respect nothing better than the music of a E602 drum, in which we perceive no
    difference except that of louder or softer. . . ." This last remark thereafter became one of the
    clichés of the day. Chapter 5 on Quantity is sensible: M. refuses to acknowledge length by
    position, accepting only (1) vowels naturally long or (2) diphthongs. Classical verse is ordered
    on the basis of such quantities, but these are quite extraneous to English meter (pp. 325-26).
    English verse, "as a species of rhythm" requires "both louder and softer sounds . . . and these
    must return at equal intervals, or such as have some other ratio to one another, otherwise,
    there is no verse." "There is however something more required to complete the verse; and that
    is, a certain number of syllables" (pp. 384-85). Added to this is only the "infinite variety" of

   <notes> Hoping to reverse the widening gap between literature and linguistics so apparent in
    versification, Pace suggests that the relation between traditional and structural metrics is
    exactly the same as that between meter and rhythm. Traditional metrics treats of "gross stress
    contrasts," by reducing all the minute degrees of stressing to one binary opposition. Meter in
    these terms is little more than a highly simplified recognition pattern. Structural metrics, on
    the other hand, describes more degrees of stressing, pitch, juncture, and other linguistic
    features, and as it increases its specificity of description it approaches the limiting case of
    one single realization (performance). This is the wide and various domain of rhythmics. But
    though we say a poem has a meter we cannot say it has a rhythm; it actually has "a rhythm
    potential (all readings) and a rhythm core (the best readings)." Thus, a Trager-Smith notation
    of a poem's rhythm core amounts to "a prescription for an ideal performance." Intonational
    ambiguities (which pertain to rhythm not meter) might be retained unresolved but would be better
    normalized. Contrast Pace's relegation of intonation to the domain of rhythm with Crystal's
    resolute inclusion of it in the domain of meter (E20). </notes>

    University Press, 1936; rpt 1970. </bib>
   <notes> (See esp. pp. lxiv-lxxiii in the Introduction on versification.) Puttenham's is the most
    extensive and important English treatise on verse- making, and also possibly the first; the
    latest editors present strong evidence of stratification in the text, the earliest draft of the
    Arte being written perhaps as early as 1569 and thus antedating both Ascham and Gascoigne.
    Puttenham made revisions steadily thereafter until the mid-Eighties, when there was a wholesale
    reworking of Book 3 and the last six chapters of Book 2. Thus the book was apparently twenty
    years in the making. Book 2 on "Proportion" is the one for us; Book 1 treats matter, Book 3,
    figures. In the first twelve chapters of Book 2 we find an earlier Tudor view of metrics, in
    contrast to the later (considerably altered) views expressed in the last six chapters on
    classical meters. In the early conception, Puttenham describes Greek and Latin verse as having
    Meters in Feet, which he denies in the vulgar languages; English is ruled solely by Number
    (syllabic regularity) and Rime (also termed cadence, or concord of tunable sound). To the modern
    way of thinking these seem too insignificant criteria, and we are surprised to see Puttenham
    making much of Rime, especially, but that is our own tinted vision. He also speaks often of
    Accent, but ambiguiously (p. 82 in Smith), seeming to mean by that term mostly pitch rather than
    stress; he also speaks of "motion and stir" and "times," but these too are hazy: "Meter and
    measure . . . [lie] with us in the number of syllables, which are comprehended in every verse,
    not regarding his feete. . . . by reason of the evident motion and stir which is perceived in
    the sounding of our words not always equal, for some ask longer, some shorter time to be uttered
    in." Thus Puttenham's (early) explanation for the inapplicability of classical versification
    rests on a (not very clear) argument about polysyllabicity vs. monosyllabicity; perhaps this is
    simply a confused realization that the times for producing English syllables are too infinitely
    graded to be classed either long or short. At one crucial point (p. 76 in Smith) Puttenham
    realizes that a line scans badly (weak iambs verge on dactyls) but cannot win his way to the
    right explanation. He does not understand Accent very clearly nor certainly in the modern sense
    of the term but he does perceive a cutting difference in the vernacular and the classical
    versifications. The bulk of the Arte is given over to his famous illustrations of staffe
    (stanza, by which he means line-lengths plus rhyme-schemes, the rhymes exerting a band or
    binding force), both for ear and eye, with a long digression on kingship. Chapter 13 and 18
    (corrected numbering) do indeed "say otherwise" and "seem contradictory," but the reference to
    classical meters as "scholastical toys" suggests a tone not entirely serious. And the strategy
    Puttenham is suggesting is indeed a clever one, designed to solve a conceptual problem by
    semantic sleight-of-hand, or casuistry. All of the "auncient feete" may be introduced into
    convenient and agreeable use, "according with our ordinary times and pronunciation," by a simple
    means, which is "to allow every word polisillable one long time of necessitie, which should be
    where his sharp accent falls in our owne ydiome most aptly and naturally. . . ." In short,
    quantity will be abstracted to the sense of ictus and filled in the lines by stress rather than
    length. No Law of Position will be allowed for English, since Puttenham believes that its
    justification even in Latin rests on nothing but "bare tradition." Of "auncient feet" he will
    allow twelve. In a moment of candor, though, he can confess that "in very truth I thinke [my
    remarks] but vaine and superstitious obseruations nothing at all furthering the pleasant melody
    of our English meeter . . . and rather wish the continuance of our old manner of Poesie,
    scanning our verse by [count of] sillables rather than by feete. . . ." Finally, note the
    half-confused conception of "breaking" in chapter 18; this is a groping realization that the
    metrical value of English syllables depends on where they are deployed in the line, rather than
    inhering in the syllable per se by definition, as in classical verse. Thus the shifting of words
    one slot over in the line will "break" an iambic rhythm into a trochaic. Puttenham grasps,
    dimly, that rhythm reinforces meter most strongly when word- and foot- boundaries coincide,
    though he admits he does not know why (p. 138 in Smith; see also pp. 130-31). Two supplementary
    studies which may be of interest: </notes>

    "iambic," i.e. metrical? Some theorists have claimed that stresses on the fourth and sixth
    syllables of the decasyllabic line are sufficient, and Pyle shows that by shifting the whole
    line (and its stress-pattern) right or left under the metrical grid a fit can be obtained and
    the principle verified. The fourth or sixth position must be weighted, and if the eighth is
    weighted the tenth need not be, but if it is not then the ninth must be, in order to insure that
    a line will not be judged positively unmetrical, though for it to be judged positively metrical,
    more complex rules are required (pp. 122-24). (These are extended and simplified in Pyle's later
    study, above.) This study is to be placed with the other inductive studies--Mayor, Bridges,

    observes (correctly) that the traditional bivalent scansion system of metrics cannot express (or
    account for) certain kinds of information in the poetic line. (This observation raises the
    larger theoretical question of what kinds of features a metrical system should be designed to
    denote at all, though this question is unfortunatelynot explored here.) Radavitch then proposes
    an alternative scansion sysem with eight degrees of stress, indicated by numerical superscripts
    from 1 (weakest) to 8. (Note that this system doubles the members of each of the four categories
    in Trager-Smith.) He believes that "poetic stress" is a composite of four stresses: metrical,
    lexical, durational, and line-pattern. A middle section presents the differences between Music
    and Metrics (he is aware that the eight levels of the metric could correspond to the musical
    octave) and then applies the "numerical notation" to indicating pitch-patterns in musical lines
    (the confusions of this section are as instructive as its conclusions). Two sections explore
    four kinds of "governing rules" or "grammars" of the poetic line: these are rules of language,
    poetry, the poet, and the line itself; violation produces "language syncopation" (otherwise
    known as metrical variation). Concluding analysis of Stevens' "Anecdote of the Jar." Altogether,
    the exposition and terminology seem luxuriant. It would seem that the few criteria for "poetic
    stress" are so broad as to nearly eliminate any consensus on a correct scansion of a line, given
    the eight degrees of stress. But the author believes that a computer could be programmed to
    perform scansions automatically. </notes>

   <notes> Paraphrase of the refulgent passage on pp. 268-69 seems a transgression. Ransom
    delineates four kinds of transactions between meter and sense in poetry: there is the "abstract
    meter with a simple repetitive rhythm," the "pure vocables," but at times this metrical pattern
    "must accommodate itself to the logical pattern of the words," and if at that point "some
    brilliant and perspicuous prose rhythm" can be found to overlay the simple meter, then the poet
    will have achieved a "counterpoint . . . the very special aural beauty of a metered work." But
    at the same time "the meaningful or signifying patterns of the words intend to be fully
    logical," but when the meter interferes, other words will have to be found. This might seem a
    shortcoming, "but often we feel that the greatest glory of the poem turns on its individual
    phrases when they conflict with but accommodate themselves to the meter. They will have come to
    their present form after much trial and error; and the successive versions will have been tested
    for their substantive brilliance as well as for their capacity for making oral counterpoint."

   <notes> An edition of 100 copies. Like Sylvester (E402), Rosenberg takes a mathematical approach
    to meter, though apparently he only intends his analysis to apply to Projective Verse. He writes
    rules to convert linguistic strings into abstract Stress Symbols, then rules to show how such
    sequences may be combined and how phrasal-stress patterns are adjusted when discrete phrases or
    words are marshalled together into meter, and finally rules to show when such sequences will be
    metrically admissible. He retains the concept of the metrical foot. His catagories of
    "stress-fixed" and "stress-shifting" metrical schemas sould like echoes of Chatman's
    "meter-fixed" and "meter-fixing" (E713), but one other distinction he makes is I think original
    and important: "for homomorphic metric schemes the conception of the foot break is prior to the
    conception of the line break, and the line breaks will respect the foot breaks. For
    non-homomorphic metric schemes, on the other hand, the line break is prior to the foot break and
    scansion can only occur once the line is determined." This merits "unpacking," as the
    philosophers say. </notes>

   <bib> -----. Historical Manual of English Prosody. London: MacMillan, 1910; rpt New York:
    Schocken Books, 1966. 340 pp. </bib>
   <notes> With an introduction by Harvey Gross. Speaking of the theory and method which lay behind
    his three-volume History of English Prosody (A8), Saintsbury himself observed: My object was not
    to construct an a priori theory of prosody at all, but to examine the prosodic substance of
    English poetry as a whole, and to discover, if possible, in what way it was constructed. I found
    . . . that a system of syllabic equivalence and substitution composing, and equating or
    contrasting, different prosodic units for which I kept the old traditional name of feet pervaded
    the whole of it. . . . Into the origin and nature, as distinguished from the contrasted value
    and arrangement, of long and short syllables I did not enter, beyond pointing out that neither
    accent, nor stress, nor except in a purely differential sense, quantity, would account for it
    satisfactorily. By differential, I mean that things of one kind were short, and those of another
    long, with an occasional faculty of change usually called commonness. And there was an end to
    it. (Some Recent Studies (E643)) Such a statement of principles--it is a relatively accurate
    self-assessment- -is dismaying, to say the least. As a serious method for intellectual inquiry,
    it seems to simply disdain all rational, orderly, self-conscious method. The judgment of it
    given by T. S. Omond (himself an opinionated but nevertheless a scrupulously fair critic) is not
    extreme: I think most readers of his volumes will share my surprise at the resolute way in which
    their author declines to discuss the phenomona which he chronicles. . . . He talks of "long" and
    "short" syllables, without saying what they mean, and says he might as well have called them
    "abracadabra and abraxas." His scansions are a glorious higgledy-piggledy of iambs and trochees,
    or dactyls and anapests, without any clue as to how these can be interchangeable. He not only
    does not know how feet are constituted, but he resolutely refuses to inquire. His really
    reckless use of the terms "long" and "short" with deliberate avoidance of their meaning leads
    him into terrible pitfalls when he comes to deal with quantitative verse. . . . Matchless as an
    historian of our verse, as an analyst he is not only nought but wishes to be so. No adequate
    account of our verse-structure is to be found in these otherwise admirable volumes. (A5, pp.
    250-51) It may be said, then, by way of synopsis, that whenever Saintsbury found himself in a
    tight place, and forced to explain himself fairly clearly, he always (forgive me) took to his
    feet. His metrical treatise adopts, wholesale, almost shamelessly, the old classical terminology
    of Longs and Shorts, and the scanning of verse in feet. For the study of classical verse, this
    apparatus had already been in use for over two milennia before Saintsbury's time, though as
    applied to the versification of English it had been a demonstrable source of confusion--and
    generally discredited--for over three centuries when Saintsbury took it up so fiercely. His
    theory treats its constituents, Quantity and the Foot, as utter abstractions, mere counters, not
    requiring the slightest natural explanation. "'Does length,' some people ask, 'really mean
    "duration of time" in pronouncing?' This question, and others, seem to the present writer
    unnecessary." So it is not vowel-length that determines quantity, nor will Saintsbury allow any
    Law of Position. His Foot Theory will have nothing to do with any Temporalist notions either, as
    witnesses his critique of Lanier (A8, vol. iii, pp. 493-97). Yet at the same time he confesses
    "of the isochronous interval" that "I believe in it myself, though I prefer to economise letters
    and call it a 'foot,'" (III, 439-40), and he does accept the concepts of the monosyllabic foot
    and the metrical pause, indeed to the point of allowing feet entirely filled by pauses, which in
    any syllable- and stress-counting metric is impossible. But the Accentualists suffer worse at
    his hands than any of the rest: "a man who goes by feet can never really go by accent . . . the
    pure accentual system is totally inadequate. . . . to rule accent altogether out of English
    prosody would be, to me, absurd. You must keep it in its place, and take care that that place is
    a minor or subsidiary one" (iii, 515, 496). However, a close inspection of Saintsbury's
    pronouncements on the accentual theory of meter suggests that he thought it counted stresses but
    not syllables; he seems to have had the misconception that stress-metrists believe all English
    verse to be merely accentual verse rather than accentual-syllabic verse. If so, that would
    indeed be a flagrant misprision, but not so flagrant as the one that Saintsbury commits in
    scanning the Old English and ballad meters as foot verse. He mistakes foot verse for stress
    verse and stress verse for the footed. Saintsbury rejects, then, both timing and stressing,
    though he misconceives, I think, both theories to some degree, while at the same time accepting
    some aspects of both theories. He was not one to be bound by the chains of consistency; But
    finally there can be, I believe, no middle ground. The two theories cannot be reconciled on the
    same plane. And on such a criterion, and even with all his evident ambivalences, Saintsbury must
    be said to scan mainly by stresses. In Saintsbury's defense, however, two things may be said.
    First his conception of Equivalence (Substitution) is a necessary and vital part of any coherent
    theory of meter (Saintsbury himself thought elision "hideous"). Trochaic substitutions in the
    fifth feet of iambic lines are unquestionably verboten. Second, the Foot Theory becomes vastly
    more attractive if we interpret Saintsbury's length or quantity to mean metrical ictus. The
    concept of ictus is a very respectable one these days, and not any the less so for its not being
    very well understood. It is in fact true that the ictus in English verse can be filled by any of
    a number of phonetic features--stressing, change of pitch, duration, timbre, any unusual feature
    of articulation. Since the phonetic basis of metrics still remains obscure in its fine details,
    we are in one sense no further along than Saintsbury was, and if we thought he knew what he was
    doing we might think him wise to refuse all pat and premature answers. It is for such reasons as
    those above that the first Book in the Historical Manual is essentially worthless, since it is
    there that Saintsbury presents his system. The second and third Books, however, presenting
    (respectively) the history of the poets' verse-technique and the metrists' theories, are
    admirably succinct. The fourth and last Book of "Auxilliary Apparatus" contains an unfortunately
    dogmatic Glossary and a too-brief bibliography, but it also contains two other resources nowhere
    else available--a list of major English poets, summarizing the prosodic achievements of each,
    and a list of major English verseforms, explaining the origin of each. Altogether, the design,
    scope, and convenience of the Historical Manual make it a useful work even yet, and after proper
    exhortations of caution, one can still recommend it to advanced undergraduates. </notes>

    of eighteenth-century metrical theory is a transitional one: he is very intent to preserve all
    the old trappings of Quantity in his metric, yet he admits the ligitimacy of the substitute
    Accent, and he denotes syllables by musical notes as well. He defines the foot as "so many
    sounds as may be united together in One Movement"; "they are distinguish'd by different Names,
    according to the different Quantity or Disposition of the TIME in which we pronounce 'em, or the
    Stress of the Voice that is laid upon 'em." The equivocal or persists throughout. The syllables
    "Of Harmony," for example, "if we regard the Time only, [are] two Pyrrhicus's, but the Former,
    [of these is] distinguish'd by a strong Accent, which gives it, to an English Ear, the Force of
    an Iambick." He allows six elementary feet (spondee and tribrach), excluding the pyrrhic; its
    "Defect of Time is, in some measure, supply'd by a Stronger or Weaker Accent." The Appendix to
    the Postscript is noteworthy for the antipathy to elision that it expresses--a commonplace for a
    century thereafter--and for a couplet, contrived to illustrate the equality of timing in the
    lines despite variances in count of syllables, which become something close to a touchstone in
    the later prosodic literature. Say shows some indebtedness to Pemberton (E611), but he is
    important historically for his stiff resistance to strict syllable-counting ("Smooth and
    Unvaried Uniformity of Numbers") and his early approval of metrical expressiveness. Fussell's
    rapturious estimation of Say (E34, pp. 111-17) is, however, an over-reading. Both the temporal
    and the accentual theories of English meter are embraced by Say. </notes>

   <notes> Sheridan opposes application of all foreign metrical systems to English: it has neither
    the strict syllabism of the French nor the quantities of the classical meters. He is emphatic
    about the accentual basis of English meter: the English poet "need not pay the least attemtion
    to quantity." He even believes that accent regulates quantity in English, as did so many
    grammarians, but with a twist: in Sheridan's view the accent may fall on either the vowel or the
    consonant of an English syllable: if on the former, then the vowel is lengthened, as is the
    syllable, but if on the latter, then the syllable is shortened. This idea he reiterates in all
    four of his treatises. Metrical feet he thinks "correspond to bars in music," though he does not
    press the analogy and in fact keeps its members distinct. He allows eight feet, four disyllabic
    and four trisyllabic, giving them such names as "third trisyllabic," etc.; the monosyllabic foot
    ("syllabic iambus") is also allowed. Wooden regularity in meter is deplored, and trochaic,
    pyrrhic, and spondaic substitutions are allowed for variety. Strict regularity of stress in
    verse is of course proper, as it is in music, but is superseded by the demands of Variety and
    Expression. It is Sheridan's unique theory of accent which allows him to hold that English verse
    has both that which the classical verse had, and more--i.e., that our verse has feet formed on
    both quantity and accent: "we are not only allowed the use of all the ancient poetic feet . . .
    but we have duplicates of each, agreeing in movement, though differing in measure, and which
    make different impressions on the ear, an opulence peculiar to our language, and which may be
    the source of a boundless variety." But this bivalent system eventually leads to disaster, as
    Sheridan is forced to revert to the classical terminology for the quantitative feet while
    employing his own for the accentual feet, simultaneously; the double system becomes a double
    bind. The whole thing is clearly unsupportable, though Sheridan ploughs ahead manfully. Sheridan
    may have developed his theory as early as 1762 (cf. his Lectures on Elocution and Dissertation
    of that date). </notes>

    this account is very similar to that in all Sheridan's earlier ones: he urges again his idea

    urges that in the recitation of verse the lengthened vowel be held strictly twice the duration

    a poet without versing, and a versifier without poetry"), but Sidney only faces the issue
    squarely near the end. Though he had tried his hand at quantitative verses in the Arcadia, the
    mood for experimentation soon dissolved in the face of the prosodic realities of making verse in
    English: "Now, of versifying there are two sorts, the one Ancient, the other Modern: The Ancient
    marked the quantity of each syllable . . . the Modern observing only number (with some regard of
    the accent); the chief life of it stands in that like sounding of the words, which we call Ryme.

    merits further work: Skeat was a distinguished scholar, and his metrical system presented here
    (taken from the 1888 Accent and Rhythm perhaps by J. Blake (E484)) is intriguing. He dismisses
    the concept of "foot" as a vestige of a foreign metric and argues instead that the metrical unit
    in English is a clustering of weak syllables around each stress. The groups he allows are: Tone
    (Ì ), Accent (Ë Ì ), Cadence (Ì Ë ), and Extension (Ë Ë ). (Reasons are given for excluding
    other possibilities.) These four types produce sixteen possible forms of five-stress (and also
    four-stress) lines. The principle for defining these metrical units is clearly
    morphemic-syntactic, and one is left to wonder what other priniciple might be preferable. What
    is lost here, one sees, is the counterpointing of metrical units against word- and
    phrase-boundaries. But then again some descriptive adequacy is gained. </notes>

    their proclitics and enclitics. </notes>

   <notes> An important essay, despite its location: Taglicht quarrels with Wimsatt &amp; Beardsley
    and others over the degree of abstraction that meter achieves over the phonological features

    recitation, but that "by no process of abstraction . . . does it seem possible to arrive at the
    traditional metrical foot." The relevance of a given phonological feature for meter is not a
    matter of either-or [this is the received opinion] but of degree, so that a "scale of delicacy"
    is possible in analysis: the patterning of a feature may or may not be included in metrical
    analysis depending on what degree of description is desired. The terms "meter" and "rhythm" are
    nearly useless by now; "architectonic rhythm" and "pictorial rhythm" would be better. Syllables
    in English bear stress (here, "rhythmical stress"), "accent" (intonational prominence), and
    "tone" (pitch)--making up four degrees of prominence altogether. A metrical analysis
    discriminating all four varieties turns out to be (based on the examples here) remarkably
    delicate. </notes>

   <bib> Tarlinskaja, Marina. English Verse: Theory and History. The Hague: Mouton, 1976. 351 pp. </bib>
   <notes> Rev: by Bjorklund in PTL 4 (1979): 192-95; by Standop in Anglia 97 (1979): 218-32. I
    believe it was C. S. Lewis, in his essay on "Metre," who first articulated the modern
    disparagement of inductive studies of meter. Tarlinskaja's massive study should put that ghost
    finally to rest. Surpassing the work of Omond, Bridges, Smith, Stewart, Chatman, Halle-Keyser,
    and Tsur in both scope and detail, EVTH is the most extensive and most important study of
    English verse- structure produced in this century. Like the earlier analyses of Mayor, Bridges,
    and Young, Tarlinskaja's analysis is inductive, but unlike theirs her 230 pages of discussion
    and conclusions are based on a computer-assisted inventory of over 100,000 lines of verse from
    the 13th to the 19th centuries, the results of the analysis being displayed in 103 pages of
    statistical tables and charts. Hence, EVTH is truly the first work on English meter which we can
    legitimately acknowledge as both comprehensive in scope and based on a thorough examination of
    the evidence. It treats all three principal English metrical systems, the syllabo-tonic
    (accentual-syllabic), tonic (accentual), and free verse, specifically the dramatic and
    non-dramatic iambic pentameter, the iambic and trochaic tetrameter, four-stress meter (esp.
    ternary), and mixed forms--the mixed syllabo-tonic/tonic and the mixed syllabo-tonic/syllabic.
    In Tarlinskaja's theory, metrical position or ictus is distinguished from linguistic stress, the
    strong position (ictus) being filled by (a mandatory) one syllable and the weak position (non
    ictus) by (a permissible) one to two syllables. The concept of the metrical foot is affirmed and
    the five commonest meters are admitted: iambic, trochaic, anapestic, dactylic, and amphibrachic.
    Anacrusis is also noted. Meter is defined as "the alternation of ictuses and non- ictuses in a
    certain sequence, regardless of the phenomenon which serves as the basis of this alternation."
    In a given meter each of these two positions in the sequence, each of these two positions in the
    sequence will be one of two types: ictuses are either obligatorily stressed or predominantly
    stressed; nonictuses are either obligatorily unstressed or predominantly unstressed. For each
    meter investigated Tarlinkskaja develops a complex statistical profile of the accentual and
    syllabic variations, identifying the metrical norm, the deviations, (acceptable or anomalous)
    from that norm, and the metrical threshold at the far edge of deviation where the meter becomes
    some other meter or nonmeter. Chapters 1-3 treat premetrical problems, viz., the accentual
    structure of Middle and Early Modern English; Tarlinskaja affirms the existence of "doublets"
    and investigates the surprisingly high percentage (80 %) of monosyllables in English verse.
    Chapter 4 treats Middle English rhymed verse, chapter 5, the iambic and trochaic tetrameter,
    which weakened in their syllabic structure in an early stage to become four-stress verse
    (Tarlinskaja adopts the term for the Russian form of this meter, the "dol'nik"), both binary and
    ternary. Chapters 6 and 7 treat the dramatic vs. the non- dramatic iambic pentameter, and the
    final chapter, the odd hybrid verseform of Donne's Satyres. Four Appendices treat some curious
    and intriguing problems in comparative versification. This is a seminal monograph, full of a
    wealth of information by no means yet fully mined. It should also demonstrate to anyone not yet
    apprised of the fact that it is not the English who are pioneering the study of verse in this
    century. The study is based on ten years of previous research: </notes>

    syllable is determined first of all by semantic and grammatical (chiefly syntactic) factors. A
    scansion system is proposed for phrasal stress with three degrees ("strong phrasal stress,
    secondary stress, and lack of stress"), each degree having also two subdegrees, with different
    symbols for occurences in ictic and nonictic positions in the line (making twelve in all). (The

   <notes> Glossing Lehmann (L457), Tarlinskaja explains the shift from OE stress-verse to the

    of the language. Statistical analyses of King Horn against six other ME poems and some ModE ones
    reveals their accentual, syllabic, and metrical structure. These patterns turn out to be
    "diffused," i.e. not clear-cut, but in general the ME line contained eight syllables, three to
    four stresses (almost equally distributed), and four ictuses. (King Horn has six, two to three,
    and three.) A considerable number of other specific features are also analyzed statistically.
    Conclusion: though ME poetry shows mixed and transitional forms, it mainly displays "an

   <notes> The article is about evenly divided between analyses of Stress Verse and Syllable-Stress
    (accentual-syllabic) Verse. In the first half (drawn in part from E678), Tarlinskaja examines
    the Middle English rhymed verse of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, especially King Horn
    and four other poems. Tabular data is presented on Number of Syllables per line, Number of
    Stresses, Number of Ictus Positions, Lines with Iambic beginnings, and Disyllabic occupancy of
    nonictic positions (the loosening of the accentual-syllabic pattern). Lines missing a syllable
    at the caesura also seem characteristic of the period. The second half of the essay examines
    Modern English verse with respect to syllabic variation (mono- or di-syllabic in nonictic
    positions) in Donne, Pope, Shelley, and Byron. Donne is found to be the poet closest to the pure
    accentual pattern, with more syllabic variation than his successors. E683a -----. Three Studies

   <notes> A lengthy statistical analysis of samples from nearly all the major English poets reveals
    the location of the limen between Metrical and Unmetrical in the poetic line. At what point does
    iambic verse becomes non-metrical? If more than 5% of the lines have disyllables in a weak
    (nonictic) position; if more than 25% lack stresses in nonictic positions; if more than 21% have
    stresses in nonictic positions. No more than 2% of the lines may have no more than 5
    "non-typical" syllables. Overall, English iambic verse contains about 2% unmetrical lines.
    Conclusions apply to "non-dramatic Modern English iambic pentameter." The method used here
    synthesizes concepts from both traditional and generative metrics in order to locate the
    "marginal thresholds." </notes>

   <notes> From the august, nearly rhapsodic tone of this piece I had almost thought it by Ransom;
    was it for him, at least? Thompson chides Stein for attributing to meter functions which are
    properly those of intonation, or performance; what meter is and does, utterly by itself, is not
    easy to see: the most one can say, Thompson concludes, is that "meter is nothing but an
    imitation of language. . . . Imitation itself is the sufficient reason of meter. For what poetry
    imitates . . . is the structure of the language itself. . . . Art comes to reality through
    artifice." Toward this end, T. shows that in Sidney's verse there are two attitudes toward
    meter: in the Arcadia, the linguistic stresses are matched precisely and supply to the metrical
    pattern; in Astrophel and Stella the correspondence is no less exacting, but "Sidney manages to
    combine a formal satisfaction of the metrical pattern with phrases whose stresses frequently
    violate that pattern." I. e., the meter so prevails over speech stresses which within their
    phrases so thwart it that nearly every syllable in the line is emphasized, giving a remarkable
    elevation to the whole throughout. Sidney's meter, then, is "supremely contrived," and it was
    his genius to see that two systems could interact while being kept separate. </notes>

    based on number of feet and not number of syllables in the line; he also argues that Milton did

    anyone's notice beyond one inspection because the weight of the book rests on an eccentric
    (hence irritating) new terminology for all the old familiar devices. For that, oblivion. Yet he
    can also lucidly separate the quantitative from the accentual prosodies, recognizing that the
    old, dogged effort of the grammarians to preserve the Latin system and force it onto English, by
    calling accented syllables long and unaccented short, caused irreparable harm and literally
    centuries of delay in the advance of clear thinking. That recognition is just, salutary, and
    valuable. E695 Watts, Isaac. "The Author's Preface" to his Horae Lyricae. Poems, Chiefly of the

    elaborates a pious defense of poetry against the charge of profanation, maintaining that verse
    may properly be used by the Christian pen to win souls away from baser attractions. Watts
    approves of sonnets, "the free and unconfined numbers of Pindar," Miltonic blank verse, heroic
    verse (couplets), and "the narrow metre of our Psalm translators" (ballad meter) as appropriate
    forms. He considers Milton too long in his periods, too "harsh and uneasy" in numbers, and too
    quaintly uncouth in diction. But couplets should have an equal "variety of cadence, comma, and
    period. . . . It degrades the excellency of the best versification when the lines run on by
    couplets, twenty together, just in the same place, and with the same pauses." </notes>

    quantity like the Greek, but for us "the quantities of syllables are but the variations of
    accent." English meter has feet (but not monosyllabic ones); the pentameter consists of "five
    feet, or ten syllables" and must end in an iamb, two trochees in a row being offensive. But Webb
    is strongly in favor of trisyllabic substitutions for expressive effect. (On this point Fussel

   <notes> A review of Gross (E38); though Wimsatt is not especially excited to see a new statement
    of "the normal expressionist theory," yet he does admit its persuasiveness--he only wants more
    precision in description and explanation. So, too, Gross comes in for some chastisement for
    bardolatry of the moderns. Yet the two prosodists are in considerable agreement on the tenets of
    an accentual theory of meter, most of which Wimsatt sketches out. See, too, his very important
    observations on the "iambic?/trochaic?" problem [my term] at the end. There is much of Gross
    here, but more of Wimsatt. </notes>

   <bib> Wimasatt, W. K., Jr., and Monroe C. Beardsley. "The Concept of Meter: An Exercise in
    Abstraction." PMLA 74 (1959): 585-98. </bib>
   <notes> Rpt in Chatman and Levin (A21), pp. 91-114; in Gross (A23), pp. 150-67; abstracted in
    Seboek (A19), pp. 193-96. Followed by two very important exchange; see below. A landmark white
    paper in the history of English metrics: Wimsatt and Beardsley's essay is undertaken as an
    explicit restatement and defense of the traditional account of metrics against two newer
    systems, the structural- linguistic and the temporal-musical. The authors criticize Chatman for
    an "insufficient [pragmatic] concern for the normative fact of the poem's meter" over and above
    the level of linguistic features, and they criticize Whitehall for failing to differentiate the
    level of isochronism (rhythm) from the level of isoaccentualism and isosyllabism (meter). The
    Trager-Smith analysis "may be helpful" but it also "may be in excess of any strictly metrical
    need." But more generally, the objection to linguistic metrics is that "the poem is not to be
    identified with any particular performance of it, or any set of such performances. . . . not
    everything which is true of some particular performance will be necessarily true of the poem. .
    . . A performance is an event, but the poem itself, if there is any poem, must be some kind of
    enduring object." Temporal metrics may be classed together with linguistic--since timing is a
    linguistic phenomenon--as equally (mistakenly) performance-oriented. And the problem with
    musical scansion is that it specifies time-values too precisely; it is directive rather than
    descriptive. Verse can indeed be isochronic, but do we know that it is invariably so? Meter,
    however, inheres at "certain rudimentary levels of linguistic organization" where the only
    important feature is "relative degrees of stress . . . in certain positions." In the authors'
    view the two principles of English meter are not time and stress but rather stress-counting and
    syllable-counting; these produce the two chief metrical systems in English, stress verse and
    syllable- stress verse, relatives whose affinity is obvious but ancestry obscure. Northrop Frye
    was mistaken to identify the pentameter line as an overlay or higher level of the four-stress
    line. But it is the Relative Stress Principle--whereby the slack of one foot may be stronger
    than the stress of another, judgments being allowable only within the foot--that is the linchpin
    of English syllable-stress meter. (Wimsatt and Beardsley also accept the Allophonic
    Principle--the second of two equal impulses will be heard as louder--and its implication, the
    impossibility of pyrrhics and spondees.) Other metrical orderings are possible, such as the
    hierarchical multiples of "dipodic feet." The structural linguists, however, are right to focus
    on the matter of tension (the authors prefer to substitute the term "interplay" for the same
    idea), as in the promotion and supression of medial stresses so as to conform to the meter. The
    meter is one of the two poles generating that tension, and not the tension, or a result of the
    tension. How do we know? "You can write a grammar of the meter. And if you cannot, there is no
    meter. But you cannot write a grammar of the meter's interaction with the sense, any more than
    you can write a grammar of the arrangement of metaphors. . . . the free and individual and
    unpredictable parts of the poetry. You can perceive them, and study them, and talk about them,
    but not write rules for them. The meter, like the grammar and the vocabulary, is subject to
    rules." A retrospective, after two decades, may find some of the fine points of this essay
    decidedly blurry, and it may be surprised to notice a curious repetitiveness of structure, but
    these are mere quibbles against the solid mass of this seminal essay. Naturally, the essay
    provoked sharp responses soon after: see the ensuing exchanges between Wimsatt and Beardsley and
    Joseph Hendren (E357) then Elias Schwartz (E328). See also B. Q. Morgan (E603). (Written for or
    just after he returned from the Indiana Conference on Style in 1958; the Kenyon forum was 1956.)

    meter promotes stresses or that emphatic stressing influences the line: he will allow only
    "normal stressing." On line-division or segmentation he asserts that poems on the linguistic
    level do not have lines; only if a literary text can be produced can a graphic segmentation
    analysis be made. What is to be the unit of verse must be stipulated by arbitrary convention
    from the literary point of view not from linguistic (i.e. oral) analysis. Segmentation is more
    often phonological than grammatical. </notes>

   <notes> An experiment designed to test Chatman's theory that the heard stresses depend on the
    "pressuring" of the "metrical set" (E713). The conclusion falls against that theory, though
    there was no consensus among the subjects, who were asked to mark down which syllables they
    heard as stressed when a poem was read aloud to them. Notice in the tables of results how
    agreement among subjects falls off, progressively. Wode notes that none of the subjects ever
    marked an unstressed syllable as stressed due to "set," but judges also--albeit
    tentatively--that from the notations of the subjects no reliable information about the
    linguistic structure of the text can be gained. Areas for further clarification: time allowed,
    and the poetic expertise and social structure in the group of subjects. But note that Wode does
    not distinguish stress-verse from foot-verse. </notes>

   <notes> Chapters 6, 7, and 11 present what is as much an original theory of versification as a
    study in Bridges, for it is indeed novel to maintain that neither Chaucer nor Milton wrote
    iambics, that the iambic pentameter is not accented on the even syllables, that Bridges
    misunderstands Milton's prosody in every way, that the whole of English versification is one
    long, gross "mistake." Young patiently explains to us that English verse is actually scanned by
    speech- cadences and simple isosyllabism of line, but concludes that the right road for poetry
    in the future is that of true quantitative hexameters. </notes>

    meters in a more diminished form than Saintsbury or Schipper. He is firmly a "Stresser" (p. 86)
    and will hear nothing of isochrony; he explicitly separates the domains of rhythm and meter. Six
    chapters on theory treat the norm and its variations by "stress-shift," "defect of syllable,"
    "extra syllable," and "mid-line primary variations." The remainder of the book traces the
    history of the "cinquepace" (pentameter) line in all its forms from Middle English to Tennyson,
    with chapters on Milton and "Shakespeare as a Metrist." </notes>
