   <notes> More a systematic argument in the theory than an inductive comparison of the metrical
    styles of Donne and Pope at Satires. Chatman follows an unimpeachable definition of meter--"a
    systematic literary convention whereby certain aspects of phonology are organized for aesthetic
    purposes"--with an enumeration of the types of metrical variation--"intra-systemic variation,"
    either by displacement of metrical points or a change in syllable-count, or "countermetrical
    variation," either by weak stresses under ictus or strong stresses outside of ictus or else by
    the choice of junctures--an explanation of "the impression of speed" in verse (if it is not a
    "lexically-induced illusion" it is caused by addition of extra syllables or else weak stresses
    under ictus), a very succinct survey of the types of elision, and a distinction between poetic
    style, interpretation, and performative style. On sound-patterning he deprecates mimesis, offers
    an anatomy of devices, and observes that "the rhyme actually may provide information by limiting
    the possibilities of interpretation." Close analyses of the poets are interpolated. N. B.: "I
    have never been able to discover a good reason for assuming that a metrical accent point has any
    closer connection with the zero that it follows than with the one that it precedes." Very
    important essay. </notes>

   <notes> A part of the symposium "English Verse And What It Sounds Like" and a reply to Arnold
    Stein's notes on Donne's meters (E1070). Applying the Trager-Smith inventory, Chatman is
    insistent that there can be no ambiguity or ambivalent "hovering" in meter (as Stein maintains);
    any ambiguity in traditional scansion "is a paper ambiguity only. . . . [it] demands a
    resolution in oral performance." "The very act of performance . . . forces the reader to resolve
    ambiguities, to decide between alternatives. . . . ambiguity can only exist between the printed
    page and the reader's eye. . . ." Cf. Levin (I35). </notes>

   <notes> A simplified, clear, direct discussion of rhythmicity in verbal structures and that
    higher ordering, meter, which is "a species of rhythm." In a sequence of regularly recurring
    events, the key aspect is the prominences which mark regularity; for languages, specifically
    English, these seem to be stresses. But though it is true to insist, No metric without its
    phonetic, still no amount of phonetic analysis can discover, explain, or produce meter, since
    meter is a convention arbitrarily imposed on the language. Chatman sketches out the two most
    recent linguistic accounts of meter, Trager-Smith and Bolinger. The latter has so far been
    scarcely explored, but its early findings are intriguing. </notes>

    transcribes eight readings of the Frost poem (one of them Frost's) and marks their intonation

   <notes> Rev: by C. F. P. Stutterheim in Levende Talen 239 (1967): 265-68. Up to its time the most
    significant treatise in the field of metrics since Bridges (E491); Chatman provides a full-scale
    theory of an order which has been rarely matched. His procedure is empirical throughout, and the
    study never strays very far from its data. "Meter itself is a system, parallel to and actualized
    by, but not to be confused with, the linguistic system." Chapter 2 surveys the psychology of
    rhythm, since meter is, by general consensus, a species of rhythm. A very long Ch. 3 reviews
    elementary phonology, since the relevant event or unit-object in meter is the syllable, followed
    by the nature of prominence or ictus in meter; length, stress, and pitch are closely examined,
    "stress" is defined, and the importance of pitch in stress is emphasized (following Bolinger).
    Chapter 4 reviews earlier Objective studies of meter as well as Russian Formalist/American
    Structural-Linguistic work. Chapter 5, the crux, states the theory: inductively, we do scan
    poems--meter is agreed to exist--but no one linguistic feature can be shown to be an invariable
    signal of metrical ictus. "Lexical stress unambiguously marks metrical ictus . . . unless
    overridden by [phrasal stress]"; in confusing or ambiguious contexts, the "metrical set" of
    expectations will then act to denominate the ictus and pre- serve meter. Scansion is a notation
    of the meter of a recitation, while metrical analysis is a composite summing of all the
    scansions; "the meter in this sense is a consensus, not a normative formulation." The foot is
    defended on grounds of theoretical elegance and the pyschological reality of grouping. Four
    degrees of syllable-stress are denoted (a, b, c, d) producing thirty-two varieties of disyl-
    labic feet, excluding spondees, pyrrhics, ambiguous feet, and mono- and trisyllabic
    sybstitutions [hence, no "metrical pause"], which are also allowed. Chapter 6 provides a sample
    analysis of Shakepeare's Sonnet 18; eleven professional recordings are analyzed on a sound
    spectrograph then checked against the judgments of a panel of expert judges; conclusions, pp.
    182-83. A final chapter speculates on the functions of meter--an important and much- neglected
    subject. See also Wode (E703). </notes>

    Linguistic Occasional Papers, no. 7. Buffalo: University of Buffalo Department of Anthropology
    and Linguistics, 1959. 50 pp. </bib>
   <notes> The monograph which constitutes the formal application of the methods of structural
    linguistics (the Trager-Smith phonology; see D32) to English metrics. Dispensing with the
    traditional binary metrical system (stressed- unstressed), the structural analysis notates all
    the intonational features present in the normal production of speech, in four degrees of each:
    stress: primary secondary teriary weak /, /\, \, Ã‹; pitch: highest high mid lowest 4, 3, 2, 1;
    juncture: end-of-word end of phrase end-of-clause end-of-sentence +, |, ||, #. Assuming also,
    then, the Relative Stress Principle (stress differences on syllables are relevant only within,
    not across, the boundaries of the metrical foot) and what later came to be called the Allophonic
    Principle (the second of two objectively equal syllables will be heard as louder--subsequently a
    much- disputed rule), the iambic foot may be redefined as "weaker-stronger," and if the metrical
    pause is allowed as well, the Epstein-Hawkes analysis yields 186 types of possible iambic feet
    (taking into consideration only stress and juncture; adding pause yields another 44, and the
    inclusion of pitch as well [the authors consider pitch peripheral, however] produces a total of
    "only" !) 6,236 types of iambic feet in English). The method is applied to Samson Agonistes.
    Varieties of trochees: 96 (stress and juncture only), besides 86 more (pause), or a total of
    2,460 (including pitch). Possibilities for the anapest run several thousand higher, with those
    for the dactyl being somewhat less, though in both cases the stress differences between the
    three syllables of the foot are characteristically quite pronounced. And though the authors
    define the metrical line typograph- ically, as a line of print, they reiterate that the basic
    patterning (unit) in meter must be binary for sheer simplicity of description. Probably the
    strongest feature of the whole structural-metric analysis is its efficacious demolition of
    larger metrical units in favor of the traditional binary and ternary units, even of binary alone
    (the ternary may be subsumed under the binary isochronically). The authors conclude that English
    verse is fundamentally iambic. On the strophic leve they recognize that the context controls the
    scansion of specific problematic lines, under a principle of greatest prevailing metrical
    consistency. The strophe does in some sense define and determine the line (meter), so it is at
    this level that an index of metrical tension becomes practicable for a text (see p. 49), an
    index which would score gradations in its features both above and below the norm ("matrix").
    "This is the difference between fine and coarse analysis," true enough, but structural metrics
    also clearly proceeds from an assumption not that meter is made out of language but that meter
    is language. In practice the authors ignore the conventionality of meter, in its reduction of
    the linguistic system. This represents, in Jakobson's terms noted by Fowler, a confusion of
    verse design and verse instance. No reader perceives six thousand types of iambs. Meter, both to
    be written and to be read, must be a very simple pattern, underneath its elaborations. </notes>

   <bib>Fowler, Roger. "'Prose Rhythm' and Meter." Fowler (A14), pp. 82-99; rpt in Freeman (A22),
    pp. 347-65. </bib>
   <notes> This lambent essay adapts the recent insights and concepts of structural metrics to
    explain how meter interacts with grammar at both its higher and its lower levels, syntax and
    phonology. The "counterpoint" of meter against syntax is essentially that of the line against
    the sentence, and Fowler shows through examples that it would be possible to construct a "scale
    of enjambement," an index sensitive to the force of the meter, essentially discontinuous,
    pulling against the force of the syntax, toward continuity. (Note that counterpoint must be
    sustained to deserve its name.) The play of metrical paradigm against the phonological structure
    of the language (stress), however, is properly termed "syncopation" not "counterpoint." The
    metrical pattern must be kept visible in order for tension to be created; otherwise the rhythm
    is "sprung" out of its proper sphere of concessions and aggressions into a simple stress verse.

   <notes> A thorough, careful review of Seymour Chatman's A Theory of Meter (E713), exploring not
    only the book and its arguments but also the assumptions and methods of structural metrics in

    twofold, but not severe: he worries about systems in which "metre is easily and relevantly
    described according to the practices of the linguists," and he urges the adoption of the full
    Trager-Smith four-level phonological system (which Chatman rejects), believing that the "full
    suprasegmental pattern . . . is metrically significant," since ictus can be created in several
    ways. The reader who hasn't the time to read Chatman entire may safely trust this essay for a
    solid and accurate understanding. </notes>

    prosodic fallacy," and he rejects the Allophonic Principle (the second of two equal sounds will
    be heard as louder). This last he reiterates. Ridland interjects that meter is more conventional

   <notes> An expansion and refinement of her earlier presentation of a structuralist metric
    (below). Hewitt criticizes the Halle-Keyser framework for failing to admit first trochaic feet
    in iambic lines, final iambic feet in trochaic lines, contiguous strong stresses, and the
    allophonic-stress principle; Magnuson and Ryder for mistakenly basing their metric on syntax;
    and Beaver for the convenient optional status of the stress-exchange rule. She then presents a
    refined version of her own theory, which contains three levels--Meter (marking ictus), Cadence
    (juncture and strong stress), and Measure (pitch pattern and stress). Thus she has a tripartite
    criterion for evaluating the metricality of a line: unmetrical, uncadenced, unmeasured. A line
    that fails all three is "irregular." Finally, she tests the efficacy of her system against
    Halle- Keyser and Magnuson-Ryder in twenty-three lines from Shakespeare's Sonnets, with detailed
    analysis. </notes>

   <notes> The scansion system of traditional metrics is too primitive, Hewitt argues, to describe
    the complex transactions and levels of English language and verse, and so she produces a
    "three-level prosodic analysis," and levels--meter, measure, and cadence--showing
    (respectively)--ictus, stress, and pitch, and stress and juncture. The meter level is binary;
    measure is rising or falling and comprises units of one stress and up to four slacks; cadence
    comprises eleven poetic and five prose feet (in Eliot). The analysis of the poem correlates
    these metrical forms with meaning, particularly the "fixity and flux" Eliot contemplates in
    "Reflections on Vers Libre." These scansions are easily the most complex I have seen. </notes>

    possibilities for contrast, tension, and clash between the rhythm and the meter. Trager-Smith

    middle levels of stress may be variously promoted to ictus or suppressed to nonictus depending

    "stress-timed." Whitehall concludes with an outline of global verse-systems: ________syllabic

    isoaccentual | | | | Vedic | quantitative | | | | Chinese Greek Old English _non-syllabic

   <notes> The seminar topic was the examination of metrics "in light of phonemic theory," since
    "there is no phase in literature where there is a more intimate relation between the structure
    of the language and the structure of the literary work than in metrics." The components of meter
    are three: stress (using Trager-Smith's four levels in the language and two levels in meter),
    juncture (three levels--rising, falling, level--vulgarly known as "caesura"), and isochronism.
    Two primary metrical traditions in English are identified: the isochronous (the native form) and
    the isosyllabic (the foreign, syllable-counting form borrowed in Middle English); there are also
    two main theoretical traditions: the traditional metrists (with concepts derived from classical
    verse), whose system is adequate only for isosyllabic verse, and the musical metrists (Lanier,
    etc.), whose system only describes isochronous verse. Both systems are said to be prephonemic."

   <notes> Both the original and revised theories of generative metrics are unsatisfactory, the
    authors argue, because they judge unmetrical all lines such as Keats's "How may bards gild the
    lapses of time" which pose the problem of "double trochee after syntactic juncture." But
    trochees are unquestionably admissible after juncture at the beginning of the line, so why not
    elsewhere? Subsequent trochees after juncture are simply generalizations of the line-initial
    case. Beaver replies politely (and correctly) that the authors do not define "juncture"
    adequately. He does not mention the fact that they do not pursue their thesis to its logical
    end, where "Never, never, never, never, never" would then be an acceptable iambic pentameter.

   <notes> An influential early article providing revision, evaluation, and "critical commentary" on
    the Halle-Keyser system. Beaver also turns to shorter-lined and trochic verse, finding that the
    "greater rhythmic regularity" in verse of short lines may be explained generatively: short lines
    are 50% denser in stress maxima. Triple meters seem to rely heavily on set syntactic formulae,
    such as prepositional phrases, which put stress on the third syllable. The traditional "foot,"
    enjambement, initial inversion, and metric stylistics are then considered in turn. Beaver
    suggests revised stress rules but insists that Halle-Keyser's metrical principles offer a
    "unified explanation" of the iambic pentameter line. The generative system, however, is
    augmented by Chatman's analysis of five types of syllables (E713). </notes>

   <notes> Argues that Halle and Keyser's conception of the "standard theory of metrics" (against
    which they are reacting) is erroneous: the perfect pentameter line is not the "norm" from which
    all variations (initial trochees, etc.) are deviations; rather, the consensus in traditional
    metrics has been that variations are a part of the norm. Nor is the perfect pentameter line any
    "ideal," since poets have so obviously labored to vary it. Thereafter, protracted attributions
    from Bridges, Saintsbury, Omond, and McAuley follow. Finally, Bowley offers his own set of four
    metrical rules, which will "account for all possible metrical patterns": these differ from the
    generative account in that "metrical variation is . . . accounted for by differences in the
    underlying metrical patterns, not by differences in the way the correspondence rules apply." A

   <notes> A lucid critique of generative work to 1976. Cable criticizes the Halle-Keyser theory for
    "two crucial flaws": (1) taking the stress maximum rather than the foot as the metrical unit,
    and (2) assuming that only stress ("segmental units") matter for meter, rather than other
    "linguistic givens" (i.e. "suprasegmentals" such as pause, duration, pitch, juncture). The "only
    progress [in Halle-Keyser] was the articulation of an explicit goal [Rules for determining
    Metricality] for the study of meter." Moreover, Cable argues persuasively that the generativists
    have been scornful of if not oblivious to much of the earlier scholarship of real value in
    metrics. He considers Beaver's work to yield some progress, in that it tries explicitly to work
    out other and better rules for metrical generation. Magnuson and Ryder's theory is dismissed
    because it lacks generalization altogether: any rule written applies only to that line and no
    other. Altogether, he concludes, the sole advance of the generative approach is the effort to
    make the metrical rules explicit. </notes>

    applied to metrics: the linchpin of Fowler's argument is that the application is based on an

    decided limitations. Most conspicuously, the linguistic model exaggerates the extent of
    poetry-as-a- piece-of-language: "although their basic material is linguistic and therefore
    subject to description in linguistic terms, metrical and literary conventions are non-linguistic
    aspects of form." Less conspicuously, the key concepts of T-G grammar, such as abstract pattern,
    tranformational rules, deep structures, competence, or grammaticality, have shown only very
    limited uses in metrics. Fowler distinguishes between the methods of theoretical metrics and

   <notes> The original statement of the theory of generative metrics, as applied to the iambic
    pentameter in Middle English; the definitions and concepts given here were much criticized and
    amended later, and this article has no final authority. See the revised version of the theory at
    E777. Halle and Keyser fix the fundamental aim of prosody as the distinguishing of metrical from
    unmetrical lines. To this end they define the abstract (deep) metrical pattern of the iambic
    pentameter line as having ten metrical positions, five even, five odd. Second, they define the
    conditions under which a postion may be occupied by more than one (surface) syllable. Third,
    they define the stress maximum (a syllable with stress greater than that on both syllables
    adjacent to it), which may (or may not) occupy an even position but may not occupy an odd one,
    as the fundamental criterion of metricality. The stress rules to be applied are lexical, and a
    provision is made for caesurae (stress maxima undergo "neutralization" across "a major syntactic
    boundary"). Two Condition rules allow disyllabic occupancy of the metrical positions. </notes>

    metrics ("A Theory of Meter"). Chapter 3 should be considered the definitive statement of the
    revised Halle-Keyser theory of generative metrics. It contains an introductory section on
    general principles, a section on Old English alliterative verse, and a section on the iambic
    pentameter. The revised rules are as follows: For Old English verse ABSTRACT METRICAL PATTERN:
    (i) A verse line is composed of a first and second half-line (ii) The first-half-line is
    composed of (X)*X (iii) The second half-line is composed of X(W)* CORRESPONDENCE RULES: (i) Each
    X corresponds to a single S, or One X in a half-line may correspond to an S and a W in either
    order DEFINITION: If in two or more stressed syllables the zero or more consonants that pre-cede
    the vowel are identical or begin with an identical consonant or s-cluster, the syllables
    alliterate. (ii) Syllables in S positions alliterate; syllables in W positions do not alliterate
    For modern English verse ABSTRACT METRICAL PATTERN: (W)*SWSWSWSWS(X) (X) where elements enclosed
    in parentheses may be omitted and where each X position may be occupied only by an unstressed
    syllable CORRESPONDENCE RULES: A position (S, W, or X) corresponds to a single syllable or to a
    sonorant sequence incorporating at most two vowels (immedi-ately adjoining or separated by a
    sonorant conso-nant) DEFINITION: When a fully stressed syllable occurs between two unstressed
    syllables in the same syntactic constituent within a line of verse, this syllable is called a
    "stress maximum" (ii) Fully stressed syllables occur in S positions only and in all S positions,
    or Fully stressed syllables occur in S positions only but not in all S positions, or Stress
    maxima occur in S positions only but not in all S positions, Since the Correspondence Rules are
    ordered from least to greatest generality, lines which violate them will be progressively less
    metrical in the same order. Lines violating rule (1) will normally be considered acceptable
    variations, while lines violating rule (iii) are simply unmetrical. Counting each infraction of
    each rule as one unit will give a numerical score of the metrical complexity (i.e. degree of
    metricality) of the line. (This procedure is unchanged from the original version of the theory.)

   <notes> Published after the codification of their theory in English Stress (which appeared in
    Feb. 1971), Halle and Keyser here reprint a succinct account of the modified theory and respond
    directly to the criticisms of Wimsatt (E814) and Magnuson-Ryder (E821). They reject Wimsatt's
    view that the meter "exerts a certain kind of coercion . . . a quiet 'promotion' of certain
    weaker syllables"--i.e., that the meter can "tilt" the "linguistic givens." The Halle- Keyser
    view is that "meter is an abstract pattern embodied in linguistic material by virtue of specific
    correspondence rules"; Wimsatt's approach is "contentless." They defend the concept of the
    "stress maximum." The Magnuson-Ryder theory is examined at length and dismissed, its rules
    having no applicable generalization beyond the separate lines they describe. </notes>

    contrasts at length the generative theories to the earlier "taxonomical" (descriptive) ones and
    rejects the notion of a "metrical competence" in speakers analogous to the linguistic
    competence. "The main fault of standard theory is . . . that it tries to grasp all possible and
    allowable deviations by means of a list" (rather than a rule). But the generative theory, on the
    other hand, "is not able to distinguish between metrical and unmetrical lines," is flagrantly
    accomodating, and "cannot establish a difference between iambic and trochaic lines." The older
    empirical theory is to be preferred to the newer theory, which is "fundamentally inadequate"
    because its formulation is "a statement on the nature of the infinite set of possible iambic

   <notes> Based on her dissertation, DAI 34 (1974): 4210A (U.S. C.). Computer analysis (using the
    Dilligan programs) of samples of the verse of the Post-Chaucerians disproves the thesis that
    these poets misunderstood the master's versification; rather, they extended metrical variation
    beyond the limits Chaucer allowed himself as well as adding new possibilities. Specifically,
    they more frequently (1) filled one metrical position with two syllables, expanding the range of
    permissible elisions, (2) elided unstressed suffixes to their roots, (3) dropped a syllable in
    position 5, leaving a rest after the caesura (Lydgate's "broken-backed" line), and (4) rhymed
    stressed syllables with unstressed. Metrical complexity scores: Chaucer, 1.8; Dunbar, 2.0;
    Hoccleve, 2.7; and Lydgate and Skelton, 3.0. Chaucer's grace and "lightness" of line result from
    stresses often falling under ictus; his followers, in contrast, often weighted their lines by
    spreading stresses into non-ictic positions. But more interesting still is the discovery that
    stress-neutralization by adjacent syntactic break is radically different from neutralization by
    adjacent stress, producing a much smoother effect stylistically. </notes>

    characterization of styles, and (3) close study of a text, Meyers distinguishes three schools of
    metrists: Traditional (e.g. Fussell, Wimsatt &amp; Beardsley, Fowler), Performance (Charman,
    Epstein and Hawkes), and Language-Competence (Halle-Keyser). Traditional metrics is "in essence
    a psychological theory" and "workable but unnecessarily complicated." The extreme variation in
    oral performances of poetry has not yet been adequately comprehended in a notation system, and
    so Performance metrics is not yet successful. Linguistic metrics, however, is "the most
    promising of modern theories of meter," because it assumes that "the language . . . together
    with the shared competence of speakers of the language, provides sufficient information for
    describing the metrical situation." In short Meyer prefers the Halle-Keyser apparatus. He does
    however admit its difficulties and suggests as partial solutions a revised notation system and a
    reduction from Halle-Keyser's de facto three levels of stress to two by dismissing the notion of

   <bib>Newton, Robert P. "Trochaic and Iambic." Language and Style 8 (1975): 127-56. </bib>
   <notes> The author collects a number of apparently trochaic lines with initial iambic
    substitutions in order to show that they can be proven metrical by the Stress Maximum Principle
    though not by traditional scansion. [Note however that the examples are nearly all in tetrameter
    verse, that the percentages for occurrence in pentameter and tetrameter verse vary widely and
    consistently, and that Newton admits several of the sample poems are in mixed meters.
    Traditional metrics would say these lines are regular headless iambics.] Initial inversion is
    four times more prevalent in iambic verse than trochaic, and medial inversions have similar
    frequencies. Newton criticizes Hascall's approach (E783) and concludes that Structural Metrics
    by nature will never be able to give a coherent differentiation of "trochaic" and "iambic"
    lines. Halle and Keyser never will either until their generative rules are revised. Newton's own
    approach (summarized on pp. 146-52), based on the experiments of Snell, Woodrow, Warner Brown,
    and the like, specifies differences in rhythmical grouping: trochaic feet are shorter than
    iambic; the length of stress to slack is 2:1 in iambic but 1:1 in trochaic. An essay very wide
    in scope, but discomfitingly disorganized. Cf. Hascall (E783), Creek (E18), Stewart (E331), and

    examine stress maxima, assonance, alliteration, and elisions. Wordsworth and Milton turn out to
    be more similar to each other metrically than to the other three, and Wordsworth "nearly
    re-attains the level established by Milton" in "some quantitative supportable ways." Thomson and

    eliminates any possibility for an explanation of the nature of complexity. A study of the
    position of more complex lines in a poem would give us more information than the present
    "leveling" method. Kiparsky's system has gaps and cannot indicate hierarchies of accentu- ation.
    His alternation rule will not serve even if refined because it pays insufficient attention to
    secondary stresses in W-positions. The "constrastive" and "emphatic" stresses of Bierwisch also
    will not do. Schultz argues that the cyclical application of the stress rules in classical

    backwards" in metrics. More generally, Halle-Keyser are guilty of both ignoring Rhythm (i.e.
    hebungen and pauses) altogether and also of an "assumption that the poet is guided principally
    by the verbal material." Deviations in the number of syllables . . . are felt to be rhythmically
    more seriously deviant than . . . deviations in stress." The Conclusion ("Do We Need a
    Generative Theory of Metrics?"), though, is (surprisingly) judicious and open. "The root of
    Halle-Keyser's failure is not in the generative idea itself but in the hypotheses and
    assumptions which have gone into their theory." </notes>

   <notes> Despite the date of publication, most of this theory was worked out from 1969-72; it
    represents an attempt to embed the basic Halle-Keyser framework within a much wider, more highly
    formalized psychological (Gestalt) theory of meter which integrates (1) some of the current
    understanding of human processing of perceptual patterns and (2) the concept of Performance at a
    fundamental level in the theory, in order to achieve greater refinements of explanatory power,
    i.e. greater "delicacy" of description, by converting Halle and Keyser's dichotomous metrical
    determinations (metrical, unmetrical) to a continuum of finer discriminations of metrical
    complexity. The five fundamental categories of Tsur's theory along with their components are:
    DIMENSION: conventional--i.e. formal, as in meter linguistc--the phonological rules of stress
    and syntax performative--the set of conditions in which the elements of the conventional and
    linguistic dimensions tend to group into, and establish themselves as, perceptual units. Here
    the metrical set, syntactic set, and other perceptual character- istics of the auditor, the
    performer's style, and the prosodic givens pertain. CORRESPONDENCE: (essentially the three
    Halle-Keyser Correspondence Rules) Linguistic stresses in relation to metrical positions may be:
    confirming, non-confirming, or infirming, the result of which may be compensation, violation, or
    neutralization of the meter. Grouping may be either backward or forward. UNIT: Beat is the unit
    of stress, meter, and performance. STRUCTURE: Systematic hierarchical ordering of units. The
    "foot" serves as the unit of both stress and meter; above it is the line. Normal
    stress-placement in meter creates a stress-maximum; stress-displacement to the left creates a
    stress-valley, to the right a stress-grade. STYLE: At the highest level, convergent or
    divergent. A large number of specific types of metrical variations may be graded on both
    quantitative and qualitative scales in order to define, describe, and weigh features of style.
    Chapters treat Metricality, Caesura, Iambic/Trochaic and Ternary meters, Rhythmical Performance,
    Perception of Poetic Rhythm [perhaps the core of the book], Perceptual Forces on meter, syntax,
    and sense, Converg- ent/Divergent Patterns, and the Stanza. A long Epilogue appraises the
    problem of critical estimation of metrical style. The general structure of the entire argument
    is set forth in a twenty-page prefatory Synopsis. Much more is treated in the text, of course,
    and in fact the theory goes far beyond the Halle- Keyser framework (Tsur manages to put
    considerable distance between himself and them in chapter 1). Section 8 on Performance is
    especially stimulating. </notes>

    observing that the iambic pentameter has traditionally been defined precisely by its five
    stress-units. Several invented examples serve as "a challenge to the notion that a sweeping
    negative rule (plus a merely optional rule about major positive features) will render certain
    minor positive features irrelevant to a definition of a meter." The Halle-Keyser rules give
    description of metrical complications in the iambic pentameter line but not explanations how or
    why these particular complications should exist (and not others). Wimsatt adopts the
    (Structural) position that the meter alters or adjusts the mid-range stresses in speech. But
    "rules of language do not include rules of meter. The meter . . . is something that the poet
    adds to the linguistic givens, without contravening them." Finally, Wimsatt urges the
    recognition of a difference between the rule (the outer limits of legitimacy) and the norm (the
    varying, average, inner realization). </notes>

   <notes> This very substantial treatise examines the similarities and differences in English and
    German verse by applying the Magnuson-Ryder (E819-21) framework, as well as American Structural
    and Russian Formalist theories. The author observes the facts that English verse differs from
    German in that it has dropped unstressed syllables, resulting in the occurrence of contiguous
    (stressed) lexical stems in the verse, while German on the other hand, preserving its wider
    inflectional system, has preserved unstressed syllables between lexical stems, which "thus
    allows for a closer approximation to the metrical scheme." Thus English verse has a higher
    degree of apparent irregularity or "freedom." And in contrast to these two languages, Russian
    has "such a highly developed inflectional system and consequently such a high degree of
    poly-syllabicity that it does not allow for the occurrence of stress on alternate syllables."
    The general assumption throughout the work is that the possibilities of metrical form "appear to
    be connected more with the distributional properties of the language itself than with
    constraints specifically of prosody." Perhaps this will turn out to be one of the axioms of
    comparative metrics. Too, the whole area of the relation of meter and morphology, explored here
    by Bjorklund, has been ignored traditionally and deserves further, more systematic
    investigation. </notes>

   <notes> The second generative theory advanced. The authors criticize Halle and Keyser for
    inadequate and imprecise categories and "procedural incongruities," citing work on Shakespearean
    Sonnets which confounds the theory. They attack the aim of Halle-Keyser prosody (sorting
    metrical from unmetrical lines) on the grounds that since all lines imperfectly fulfill the
    abstract pattern, a heirarchy or gradient of metricality is what is needed. Finally they
    reiterate that the theory accepts too much. The Magnuson-Ryder theory proposes a metrical grid
    of ten slots, five Even, five Odd; features marked are Word-Onset, Weak, Strong and Pre-Strong.
    Of these latter, there are sixteen possible combinations. Then a set of Base Rules states the
    relations between metrical slots. See also: E721, E741-42, E749, E755, E776, E778, E791, E814,

   <notes> A criticism of Kiparsky's first theory (E827) on both general and specific grounds.
    Generally, (1) his system finally reduces itself to his "monosyllable constraint," whereby "the
    metricality of a line of poetry depends solely on whether or not the odd positions--if they are
    stressed--are filled with monosyllabic words"; (2) a metrical theory based on the line as unit
    and on the counting of its syllables cannot very well distinguish iambic from trochaic.
    Specifically, (1) Kiparsky's rules are too narrow to be borne out in the corpus of English
    verse; (2) they are also too accomodating in other respects, admitting unmetrical lines; (3)
    they are "not explanatory of English metrical practices but rather give only a superficial
    description of the syntax"; and (4) his "prosodic rule," by grading out all stresses but
    primary, ignores metrically relevant secondary stresses. Note too the important recognition made
    on p. 219. </notes>

   <notes> At once both a formidable and extended critique of Kiparsky (E827) and also an
    affirmation and modification of Magnuson-Ryder. Chisholm cites "serious flaws" in Kiparsky's
    theory, such as unacceptably weak constraints (e.g., an imprecise classification in the
    Monosyllable Constraint) and the use of four levels of metrical stresses instead of the
    customary two. But worst is Kiparsky's double-headed "failure to distinguish the three separate
    domains of music, meter, and language. On the one hand he equates musical rhythm with poetic
    meter; on the other he confuses meter with language . . . [since] his notation for the
    underlying metrical pattern consists of integers which designate stress- levels in the language.
    . . . Above all, the Kiparsky theory fails to specify precisely . . . all the categories with
    which it operates." In Chisholm's view the inadequacy of both Halle-Keyser and Kiparsky is their
    failure to postulate "an intermediate level of abstraction," the Prosodic, between the (surface)
    Linguistic and the (deep) Metrical. He then sets forth his modifications of Maguson-Ryder based

   <notes> In a major strategic revision of his 1975 theory Kiparsky adapts the very recent work on
    phonological stress by Liberman (see Liberman and Prince, D83), the central feature of which is
    that stressing is derived and expressed via tree notation (as in transformational syntax)
    instead of by numbers. This procedure is adopted because it permits major simplifications in the
    design of the theory, but more importantly because "superficially identical stress patterns are
    differentiated in the Liberman notation in a way that point by point corresponds to distinctions
    in versification." The basic pattern for the iambic pentameter in its most neutral realization
    is established as STRESS METER /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ W S W S W S W S W S Of hand, of foot, of lip, of
    eye, of brow /\ /\ /\ /\ /\ W S W S W S W S W S The metrical complexity of the line, or the
    degree of its metricality, is then a function of the matching of these two trees. Mismatches may
    be either permissible or impermissible. Kiparsky's sole criterion for impermissible matching-
    -i.e. the one situation that will render a line unmetrical--is a lexical stress (S) over a
    metrical slack (W). That is, lexical stresses must always fall on metrical ictuses. Such
    vertical mismatches are termed labeling types; bracketing types (horizontal mismatches, as it
    were), e.g. STRESS METER /\ /\ /\ W S W S W S W or summer, winter, autumn /\ /\ /\ W S W S W S W
    [i.e. trochaic words in an iambic line], are also important determinants of metrical complexity.
    Inversion or foot-reversal Kiparsky explains handily by showing that "such a labeling mismatch
    never occurs together with a bracketing mismatch." Other aspects of the theory work out
    secondary stresses, syllabification and traditional elision, level stress, metrical idiolects,
    the iambic/trochaic dispute, extrametrical and missing syllables, the ordering of Metrical
    Rules, and stipulation of three Prosodic Rules. </notes>

   <notes> The first formal statement of the third theory of generative metrics to be proposed so
    far. Kiparsky criticises Halle and Keyser for failing to exclude non- verse and failing to
    distinguish a sufficient number of degrees of stress. His view of Magnuson and Ryder is that
    "their metrical rules are adhoc and do not lead to any explanations," revealing "a failure to
    draw the right distinctions between phonology and metrics." His own theory, claiming not only
    descriptive but also explanatory and predictive adequacy, defines meter as "a system of
    correspondences between musical and linguistic rhythm" (Kiparsky speaks also of "the musical
    rhythm that underlies verse," but this seems adventitious), admits four degrees of metrical
    stress (denoted by the numbers 1- 4, strongest to weakest) which correspond to the four degrees
    of stress in the language (though Kiparsky's actual examples betray this statement and reveal
    that his metrical levels are effectually binary), and takes account of word and phrase
    boundaries as well as patterning of stresses, on the argument that meter organizes not only
    phonological but also morphological and grammatical features as well. The system includes six
    components: Acual Phonological Representation The line itself. ^ | Prosodic Rules) Specify how
    the patterns are to ^ be mapped onto linguistic strings | (by defining what counts as a |
    "syllable," etc.), i.e. how | metrical positions may match | syllables. | Derived Metrical

    ---------------- Metrical Tension Index ^ ^ | | | | | | These are two. MR1 states Gauges the
    difference between that only odd syllables in abstract and derived patterns the iambic

    that stresses in rank stylistic variations in weak positions may occur poets and genres. only on
    monosyllables or ^ after intonation breaks. | ^ | | | Abstract Metrical Patterns | A small
    inventory. In the revised version of this theory (E826), Kiparsky admits many of its original
    inadequacies and takes a new, more profitable tack. See also the criticisms by Chisholm (E824)
