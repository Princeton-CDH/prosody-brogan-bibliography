            <notes> A recently discovered rare incunabulum antedating the two Atomic Wars has been
                subjected to Total Metrical Analysis; compared with the Anglo-Saxon Fragments
                preserved in the sub-Himalayan vaults, this poem shows much less skill in
                alliteration, both in faulty verse-types and in a wooden, repetitive style.
                Altogether the poet's use of alliteration seems self-conscious and forced, as if he
                were out of touch with the tradition or trying to imitate a moribund tradition
                rather than merely being incompetent. Too, his verse frequently falls into a
                "trim-pom-trim-pom" rhythm, varied by "pom-petty-pom," which seems to be evidence
                supporting the hypothesis recently advanced that there also existed a rhymed,
                syllabic verse-tradition in Old British poetry (none of which has survived, of
                course). Whether such a syllabic tradition was only beginning at this time, or
                whether it already existed and was influencing this poet's attempt at revival of an
                earlier form, we do not know. </notes>

            <notes> Coleridge gives all the appearances of genuinely believing that his four-stress

                line the accents, not the syllables. Though the latter may vary from seven to
                twelve, yet in each line the accents will be found to be only four." See E843, E845,

            <notes> Yeats himself considered "The Lake Isle of Innisfree" his first poem with
                something of his own music in it, that rhythm being characterized especially by "a
                succession of stresses"; the comparison with Sprung Rhythm comes im- mediately to
                mind (see E919), and Howarth lists a number of antecedent po- ems in stress verse.

            <notes> The second chapter examines Diction, but the focus of our attention should rest
                on chapter 3, "Mighty Metres and Jingling Bells: A Poet's Prosody," a long
                examination of metrical theory (the author is extraordinarily well-informed on
                metrics since 1950), "meter and speech rhythm" (she goes so far in distin- guishing
                the two as to offer separate scansions for a given line), rhyme, and "graphic
                representations of sound and meaning." Accepting "intensity" (stress) as the basis
                of meter, the author adapts the notation system of La Drière (E570). ED's metric is
                found to derive from hymnody, her most frequent choice being Common Meter. This is
                probably the most rigorous technical treatment of ED's poetry in print. </notes>

            <notes> All four poets employ accentual meter "almost exclusively for subjects of major
                importance and seriousness" and also to express "a sense of directness, honesty, and
                personal engagement." Hopkins of course created an entire prosody out of
                overstressing. Hardy uses stress meters relatively little on the whole, yet they
                appear repeatedly in his most intensely expressive passages. Pound uses them both as
                archaisms and to convey a sense of tragedy, loneliness, and tersely emotional
                speech. Auden uses the Old English meter as a more formalized convention, its
                associated heroic themes thereby forming an ironic contrast to modern life. </notes>

            <notes> See Whalley (E262). Discovery of Coleridge's review of Samuel Horsley's 1796
                work on Greek and Latin metrics (M104) provokes a full review of Coleridge's
                readings in and theorizing on metrics, given the prosodic ambience of the day. A
                surprising--very surprising--conclusion emerges: Patterson argues that Coleridge's
                metrical theory (he must have read Foster and Gally (M66-74) besides Horsley, in
                addition to his own classical training at school) was "quan- titative," though it
                recognized that accent in English "lengthens out" the time of the stressed syllable,
                so that the Christabel line is to measured by temporal regularity, each equal to all
                the rest in total time, and generally containing four stresses with isochronous
                intervals between them. In effect, then, Christabel was for Coleridge not
                stress-verse but timed verse (count of stress being of secondary importance), and
                his metrical theory was Temporal. The "foot" is to be discarded and the line taken
                as the metrical unit. </notes>

            <notes> The poem seens to be in stress verse, the metrical norm being a line of three
                stresses and from six to nine syllables, though possibly Arnold meant it to be an
                imitation of the Greek hexameter hemistich, the hemiepes. Nearly half the lines are
                of the form / x x / x x /, which Ranta considers a rising rhythm. There is some
                slight evidence for stanzaic patterns. But the poem is too loose to admit of any

                correlates fairly highly with poems on the theme of the sea; his stylistic traits
                are a frequent use of the metrical pause, variation of the seven-stress line with a
                six-stress line, very frequent dropping of unstressed syllables, caesuras, a line
                (wholly devoid of slacks) that seems to slip over into music and demand a musical
                scoring, expressive metrical irregularities, and (commonly) a four-line stanza. But
                the scansions and types given here seem so unsystematic as to call into question the

                METRICAL PSALTERS To all outward appearances, the stress meter of English folk verse
                has remained un- changed for well over a milennium. Moreover, the three or four
                commonest ballad meters also happen to be the musical meters of many hymns and
                popular (secular) songs as well, and so command an extraordinary latitude. Such
                unexpected modal solidarity implies that our oldest and finest lyrics are, at least
                in one sense, indeed "all, all of a piece throughout." The best recent account of
                ballad meter is that given by Malof (E581), though George R. Stewart Jr. is still
                the authority on the subject; see his two books and numerous articles. Note too that
                many of the articles in Appendix C on the setting of verse to music are con- cerned
                with ballads; see especially Boswell's work. </notes>

            <notes> A full counterweight to Bronson (N16); Coffin argues vigorously that the bal-
                lad originated in Anglo-Saxon alliterative verse and in "recited narrative obitu-
                ary verse" not in singing; the influence of music (and the device of end- rhyme) was
                only felt by the ballad later. This fact, that the ur-ballads were "more dependent
                upon linguistic than musical principles for their metrical form" can be further
                borne out by noticing that ballads are still set as stress verse, so that "not
                counting the unstressed syllables offers an area for extempo- rization in singing or
                reciting." An analogous situation appears in modern jazz. The ballad is, in short,
                verse before it is song. </notes>

            <notes> Though she was only marginally competent, inventive, and graceful at versi-
                fying, Mary Herbert (Countess of Pembroke) managed 71 stanza-forms in 107 metrical
                Psalms, no two of them having both identical stanza and meter. But though we may
                admire her attention to formal variety as an end in itself, her meters (and sense)
                are shuffling, stumbling, even lame, especially in her revi- sions of her brother's
                (Sidney's) psalms. This essay is a companion to Freer on Sidney (E869). </notes>

                for the history of versification in the seventeenth century. Freer charts out
                contiguities between the lyrics of The Temple and the old, established metrical
                forms of the Psalter (Psalms), demonstrating carefully the metrical styles of some
                of Herbert's Renaissance predecessors (esp. Wyatt and Sidney) as foils to Herbert's
                own craft and purpose (Chapters 3 and 4). Since the chief feature of all the
                Psalters was the uniform wretchedness of their verse, and since Herbert's own craft
                was subtle and complex, Freer's conclusion about Herbert's motices (religious and
                personal) and achievement (in the han- dling of his prosodic materials) is also,
                appropriately and subtly, complex. </notes>

            <notes> Freer shows how Sidney expanded the range of his expressiveness immensely, in
                his psalms, by learning to control enjambement, feminine rhyme, and syn- tax, while
                varying his metrical and stanza forms, until he had become a poet who "[thought]

            <notes> The only essential characteristics of ballad meter are stanza and rhyme;
                allitera- tion is merely an ornament. Gummere catalogues the metrical types, finding
                the "general movement" of the meter to be iambic, and notes that the tradi- tional
                explanations of origin--the septenarius of Church Latin hymns and the old native
                alliterative meter--are scarecely tenable either chronologically or formally.

            <notes> Based on his dissertation at Princeton in 1934. Rev: in Anglia Beiblatt 48

                American Folklore 52 (1939): 324-25. Hendren is still the standard and most
                comprehensive sourse available on the subject. His general method is to examine "the
                rhythm of ballad poetry by studying it primarily as a element of folk-song"; in
                other words, he conceives of metrical language as simply one of the elements in [and
                not, alternatively, a correlate to] the larger rhythmical framework of the music.
                Consequently he applies the musical notation system to verse as well, following the
                earlier Mu- sical metrists Thompson (E404) and Croll (E344). Like Lanier (E364), but
                un- like Omond (E310), Hendren thinks that the temporal basis of verse is triple
                time, not duple. The bulk of the study is organized by the ballad meters (Common
                Meter, Long Meter) and stanza-patterns. See Hendren's later monograph at E356.

            <notes> This is mainly a study of the partitioning of ballad narratives into dramatic
                scenes, of which Kupke says there are generally three; originally there were five,
                but compression of the final three into one produced the "end- weighting" or
                climactic form that is so characteristic of the ballad. The con- clusion must be
                prepared for, hence thematically there is a steady heightening throughout the three
                scenes, while rhythmically there is usually a falling-off or dimunition in the
                second part as a brief respite before the end, though of course both dimensions are
                proceeding simultaneously. The tripartite structure was termed by Axel Olrik an

                "septenary" form (otherwise known as Common Meter), has the form X / X \ X / X \ | X
                / X \ X / , the second most common being Long Meter in the four-stress a b c b

                range from two to six by employment of rests or by elision. </notes>

                308-16. An inquiry into the development of the most popular and prolific form of
                verse in English during the last two centuries, the stress verse of ballads. Stew-
                art devotes chapters to four varieties of metrical variation--(1) trisyllabic sub-
                stitutions, (2) monosyllabic feet, (3) metrical pause, and (4) dipodic verse. His
                metrical theory is Temporal, defining the foot as an approximately regular
                time-interval. His subject is delimited because "for the period under discussion
                metrical freedom began earlier and developed further in this form of verse than in
                any other. . . . The general course of metrical development in the past two
                centuries has been toward greater metrical variation. An accompaniment of this
                process has been the return of the native popular measures to literary us- age." Two
                preliminary chapters describe the standard form of ballad meter and its development
                before 1700. But two features of this study especially stand out: one is the chapter
                on Dipodic Verse; the other is one's realization here that the Temporal theory of
                meter is particularly suited to describing the structure of stress verse. See
                Stewart's later monograph at E333. </notes>

            <notes> Some important close research here on the early history of the metrical psalms
                in England. There was an early collection of (bawdy?) secular ballads, no copy of
                which survives, called The Court of Venus, which apparently was rewritten by some of
                the early religious reformers into a more virtuous form, two frag- ments of which
                survive; it is this "reformed" version that may represent the crucial transitional
                stage in the writing of the Psalms in ballad meter. </notes>

            <notes> In chapter 2 (section 4) and in chapter 9, Wither defends the propriety of
                translating the Holy Word into verse, and more specifically into a "variety of
                Numbers," on the grounds that the original Hebrew is indeed verse, even though not
                of the sort found in Greek and Latin poetry, and not in such pen- tameters or
                hexameters as are familiar to us (though if the lines seem syllabi- cally unequal,
                he reasons, doubtless the original proununciation would not have made them so), and
                on the grounds that the Hebrew does indeed Rhyme, as the Church Fathers have told
                us. And since "the Hebrews are full of variety in their Numbers, and take great
                liberty in their Verses," and since the subjects of the Psalms themselves are also
                various, it is therefore fitting that they be translated into "many kinds of Verse."
                In short, Wither believes that the Hebrew original has isosyllabism and rhyme, these
                two being sufficent cri- teria to make it "verse." </notes>

            <notes> In the Preface Woodford gropes through an opaceous argument for the ad- mission
                of trisyllabic feet into duple meters (especially in blank verse) as a sur- rogate,
                in the modern languages, for "Rhythm"--i.e. Rhyme, Woodford con- flating and
                confounding the two terms by false etymology throughout. Most of the unstated
                assumptions (hence definition of terms) here are derived from contemporary
                conceptions of the (quantitative) meter of Hebrew verse; see Baroway (L1596-1600).

                Hopkins in the 1870's has not yet been fully assayed by metrists, though we have
                begun to sift what Hopkins thought he was doing and said he was doing from what he
                actually did, which is the essential preliminary. Sprung Rhythm means stress meter
                no syllable-counting meter, and ultimately the theory pivots on precisely that
                phenomenon which will unhinge or un- spring the normal accentual-syllabic (i.e.
                alternating-stress) meter in English, contiguous strong stresses. The interested
                student must be willing to tackle the whole subject entire, for Hopkins' own
                statements are not in themselves entirely reliable. But he critical commentary here
                is not yet so voluminous as to be intimidating, as it is elsewhere in metrics.

            <notes> If, a century ago, a brilliant young student [Hopkins], his brain afire with an
                intoxicating new approach to poetry, had written out his theses and taken them to
                the Professor of Poetry [Saintsbury, Baum, anyone with the requisite ossification of
                metaphysics] for a review, he would have received in answer a version of this essay:
                "As exposition [young man,] this is disappointing. . . . I shall try to translate
                some of [your] picturesque language . . . into the conven- tional terms in ordinary
                writings on prosody . . . it still seems best to deal pa- tiently with [you], if
                only because [you are] an impetuous novice in prosody, too impatient to think [your]
                theories through before [you begin] to explain them." In any event, such is
                precisely what Hopkins receives here. Baum con- siders Sprung Rhythm "not a form of
                verse, to be scanned by feet, but a form of Prose Rhythm not amenable to scansion
                and therefore not to be explained as verse." </notes>

            <notes> Hopkins' theoretical studies in Greek metric were undertaken after his own
                creative work had been accomplished, in the main, and they bear little relation to
                his actual practice, which is Anglo-Saxon in nature and not at all like Greek. In
                fact, Hopkins' understanding of Greek metric was by and large sim- ply mistaken, as
                was that of most of the authorities of the day whom Hopkins read. (He was also led
                astray by his penchants for music and mathe-matics.) But here we may observe the
                remarkable aesthetic phenomenon of a false the- ory yielding excellent results in
                practice--even an entirely new form--by a fer- tile misapprehension. </notes>

            <notes> Far from discovering and adopting his alliterative techniques from his study of

                complex stroke of poetry rather than a sequential utterance," devel- oped these

                Rhythm (discussed on pp. 12-20) is the perfect embodiment of that aesthetic because

            <notes> A test of Donoghue's belief that poetry is most successful when meter and all
                other elements co-operate in creating sense, against the counter-theory (Ran- som,
                Hopkins at times) that meter provides merely an "independent phonetic pleasure," by
                undertaking to show that "when in Hopkins the internal [rhyme, alliteration, or
                lexical compounding] pattern is heavier than the sense pattern, there is grave risk
                of an uncreative distortion of the language." In short, Donoghue reacts to an
                unqualified admiration of Hopkins' technique by trying to show that at times it
                falls short of or overreaches its mark, the perfect fusion of sound and sense.

                cf. Ludwig (E925). H. argues that criticism of Hopkins' theory of Sprung
                Rhythm--considered purely as a theory--has always been unfavorable because critics:
                (1) rely on his "Author's Preface" to his Poems, which is unsatisfactory in many
                ways, being more an explanation of his own practice than a general theory, (2) have
                judged his theory by his practice (H. explicates the theory from the surviving
                letters and documents), and (3) give undue attention to features relatively minor in
                the context of the whole theory, such as scansion. Beyond this she does not
                go--giving an effect similar to a translation of a Rus- sian text into French for an
                English reader: we are one step closer, but not en- tirely home. See esp. chapters 3

            <notes> Rev: by Standop in Archiv 211 (1974): 134-41. Ludwig's book amounts to an
                extended exposition of Hopkins' theory of Sprung Rhythm. It is not, and was never
                intended to be, a neutral analysis or a critical commentary: Ludwig accepts Hopkins'
                system, which he wishes to dis- play with the utmost clarity, without pursuing any
                higher clarity which might modify or contravene the theory. This strategy is
                excoriated repeatedly by the implacable Standop in his bearish review (that is, he
                criticises Ludwig for not doing something he never intended to do), a review which
                very soon turns into a direct frontal attack on the theory of Sprung Rhythm itself.
                Ludwig accepts the distinctions betwen meter, rhythm, and perform- ance, and hence
                the conception of interplay or tension between the abstract metrical pattern and its
                linguistic filling. Chapter-subject: 1, general concepts of metrical theory and of

                multaneously--which obviously will not apply to verse. A metrical counter- point
                could only be "a plurality of metrical lines"--i.e. the ideal metrical pat- tern
                against the real metrical embodiment in words. </notes>

                Prentice-Hall, 1966. pp. 151-59. Too long by half, Father Ong's close scrutiny of
                the chronology of Hopkins' readings establishes that he could not have derived his
                theory of Sprung Rhythm from Milton, Old English, or anywhere else; all these
                studies come after the crucial notes of 1873-74 and the writing of the Deutschland
                in 1875. Hopkins only gradually realized the full extent of the new rhythm he was
                hearing, but he was "hearing it everywhere," which shows it was in the grain of the
                language itself, not contrived. What is remarkable is that Hopkins was the only
                major poet of his age in touch with the primary rhythms of the lan- guage. Ong's
                detailed study of Running, Counterpoint, and Sprung Rhythms reveals their
                "affinities" with Old English, with the rhythm (alternating stresses) of the
                language, and with the mainstream of English poetry continuously from Chaucer to the
                end of the nineteenth century. Hopkins did not invent "sense- stress rhythm"; he
                discovered it. Points of interest here: Ong rejects Whitehall's dipodic theory of
                Sprung Rhythm; he considers Hopkins' practice of beginning every metrical unit with
                a stress "a mere convenience" even for Hopkins himself and so he discards it and
                argues that scanning should proceed across the line-end break; he notes the
                frequency of parallel half-lines and judges that Hopkins' rhymes are "only fuller
                developments continuous with effects built everywhere into the verse." </notes>

                between Hopkins and Bridges had very significant effects on the metrical theories of
                both men: Bridges tried parodic and authentic sprung rhythm, Hopkins was intensely
                in- terested in Milton, and both explored a mutual interest in the structure of

            <notes> The new metric called Sprung Rhythm first presented in The Wreck of the
                Deutschland was less revolutionary an accomplishment than one might other- wise
                expect; when placed in the context of the increasing metrical experi- mentation of
                the nineteenth century--the more frequent use of the anapest, leading to logaoedic
                duple-triple meters--and especially when viewed against the background of a number
                of very similar effects developed slightly before Hopkins by Swinburne, The Wreck
                will be seen as not an "altogether novel invention" metrically but actually "a blend
                of conventional and sprung rhythm, with the former predominating," i.e. "an
                anapestic poem in a sprung frame." Indeed, the preponderance of the poem scans
                remarkably well as conventional mixed duple-triple meter. Hopkins' new rhythm was
                achieved with startlingly little modification of the traditional metric of English.
                As a distinct new meter the advantages of Sprung Rhythm were greater "naturalness
                and flexibility"; its disadvantages were a "frequent lack of both rhythmical and
                rhetorical clarity" (since no regular subliminal metrical pattern exists to help us
                assign stresses and disambiguate meaning in problematic phrases, we have to try to
                make out the meaning itself before we can discern the scansion; the meter itself is
                not a guide to meaning), the loss of the subtler shadings of articulation, and the
                loss of the complex counterpoint between language and meter. </notes>

                hold also that Hopkins not only read and understood Pat- more but actually corrected

                dispose of this theory easily, so he shifts his ground in the final letter, urging
                only significant parallels. </notes>

            <notes> Despite Hopkins' explicit statements that his metrical theory was based squarely
                on stress, Whitehall--skeptical of poets' critical acuity--advances the thesis that
                the stresses of Sprung Rhythm demarcate isochronous measures of time which are
                dipodic, in the sense defined by Coventry Patmore (E384). In deed, Hopkins, albeit
                unconsciously, wrote sprung-rhythm verse that "follows Patmore's theories almost to
                the letter." W. adopts the sigla of G. R. Stewart (E333) for scansions--Hopkins'
                favored patterns are SpLp, SpLO, SOLp, and SpPp--and turns in his final section to
                consider overstressing and alliteration also. See also Stobie (E944), and chapter 4

                VERSE Mainly by Marianne Moore and Robert Bridges. Serious interest in a meter which
                regulates only number of syllables is a modern phenomenon, an emblem of our de- sire
                to Make It New, though the more general principle of syllabism has always been an
                important aspect of English versification, especially in early Middle English and in
                the early eighteenth century. Bridges' Testament of Beauty seems to be the longest
                syllabic poem in the language, though (undeservedly) now nearly forgotten. </notes>

            <notes> A subtly complex argument sketched out too briefly: in all but her very latest
                work, Marianne Moore employs sporadic rhymes, fracturing of words across line-end,
                and other prosodic devices to altogether minimize the effect of her syllabic verse
                and thus render it as similar as possible to free verse, which is the form she
                originally began working in--a form where there is a distinct sense of the line as
                rhythmic unit. The "mathematical" tone which critics have noted in her poems is
                derived not from the versification but from other elements. </notes>

            <notes> Undertakes a general examination of this form and its constraints, with steady
                attention to Bridges. "In syllabics the metrical organization is not achieved by an
                arrangement of elements within the line but rather by the effect of the repetition
                of the syllabically-uniform end-paused lines themselves." Three dif- ferentia seem
                indispensable to the form: a fixed number of syllables, a roughly fixed duration of
                time or breath for each line, and an end-of-line pause (pro- duced by syntax or a
                stressed syllable). The work of Daryush, Rexroth, M. Moore, and Dylan Thomas is also
                noticed. </notes>

            <notes> An urbane consideration of the devices which render Marianne Moore's syl- labic
                verse so effective: avoiding the complexities of stanza and rhyme, she cre- ates
                "poetry without adventitious musical aid, whose units are arguments and paragraphs .
                . . not prose or the prose-poem but poetry with prose's rhetoric, complexity and
                ease." Inclusion of quotations, apt phrases and allusions, and avoidance of regular
                stress and lines with even numbers of syllables (both tending always toward the
                iambic) also secure the novelty and vigor. Milton's late work and the brilliant
                footnote to Housman's 1933 Stephens Lecture are also discussed. Syllabic verse,
                Fuller concludes, is "an extension of more tradi- tional meters, not a denial of

                constructs, his iambic mode." Ransom's strict meter, that is, often passes into

                meter to a looser iambic to "cadence" and even to "speech cadence," as he explores
                more colloquial forms of speech. But Yeats never lost his faith in meter or rhyme,
                and his increasing use of "highly irregular iambic meter" should be recognized as
                "the acquiring of new instruments, not the abandoning of the older ones." This essay

            <notes> A condensed version of his dissertation. The change in Elizabethan dramatic
                taste in the 1590's toward imitations of classical satire produced plays which,
                following the misconception of the time, were "rough" or crude in taste, themes, and
                versification. Concerning the lat- ter, "rough" seems to have meant irregular
                cadences, juxtaposed stresses, and perhaps rapid tempo. Burke analyzes the 1598 play
                The Scourge of Villanie using the scansion-method of La Drière (four degrees of
                stress); the analysis confirms Marston's own statement that he wrote Satires
                "rougher" than other genres. Burke's primary interest, though, is in the relation of
                the meter to the rhythmic phrasing-groups, those phrases and clauses set off in the
                syntax by pauses or commas. Extensive statistical tables delineate the nature and
                degree of these congruences/divergences, and indeed, I know no better study than
                this available on the complex relation of syntactic phrasing and meter. </notes>

            <notes> "To read Dryden, Pope, &amp;c., you need only count syllables, but to read Donne
                you must measure Time, and discover the Time of each word by the sense of Passion. I
                would ask no surer test of a Scotchman's substratum . . . then to make him read
                Donne's satires aloud. If he made manly metre of them, and yet strict metre;
                then--why, then he wasn't a Scotchman." "This beautiful and perfect poem ["Song"]
                proves . . . that all Donne's Poems are equally met- rical . . . but in poems where
                the writer thinks, and expects the reader to do so, the sense must be understood in
                order to ascertain the metre." All the re- marks collected here are refulgent.

            <notes> Scholarship on Wyatt has traditionally been divided, one side viewing his verse
                as iambic (if primitive), the other side viewing it as a last vestige of
                alliterative verse (showing "phrasal" units rather than feet). The present article
                accepts both positions and takes a middle course: in an age of transition, Wyatt's
                met- ric shows features of both traditions. Was that assertion even necessary?

                to stanza). The only two exceptions to this tonal/formal shift were (1) the
                preservation of octosyllabics essentially unchanged and (2) the introduction of
                anapestic tetrameters by Christopher Anstey in his 1766 New Bath Guide, a volume of
                satirical light verse. The form held sway until well into the nine- teenth century.

                197-213.</bib>
            <notes> A critique of Swallow's analysis of the "broken-backed" line in Skelton and
                Wyatt (K389). Evans shows that the inflectional ending -eth (also -es) was regularly
                employed not only in Middle English but also in Middle Scots up to the fifteenth
                century as an optional metrical device for regularizing syllable- count. It is so
                used by Wyatt as well, and he also uses it for metrical elision--to regularize
                stress-placement (the inflectional -e is an entirely different problem, but only a
                minor one in Wyatt). Hence many of Wyatt's pentameters are more regular than has
                been thought. His early work is scarcely less regular than his mature work, and
                statistically, both are quite comparable in irregularity to that o Milton and
                Wordsworth. Some of his lines were experimental, and some others were meant to be
                tetrameters. Wyatt seems rough to us because he used metrical devices in ways
                unfamiliar to us, but they are the same devices used by all the major English poets.

                pp. 181-200; rpt in Hollander's Vision and Resonance (A13), pp. 187-211. If one of
                the crucial functions of meter in poetry is expressive, the other is purely
                conventional: a poet's choice of meter is an implicit commitment to certain metrical
                styles, types, modalities, and genres, these establishing conti- nuity and
                comprising traditions, as Hollander shows in giving capsule histories of the iambic
                tradition, blank verse, the sonnet, lyric stanzas, and the anapestic elegaic meter,
                traditions which may be revised or broken at certain crucial points, "metrical
                crises," where the metrical contract between poet and reader (as defined by
                Wordsworth) is redrawn--think of Chaucer, Wyatt, Davenant, Milton, Blake, Whitman,
                Hopkins, and pound, for example. Perhaps the para- digmatic case of all is Blake,
                whose subversive-restorative metric must be the ultimate source for the twentieth
                century's obsessive-dismissive interest in meter: Blake accepted certain metrical
                conventions of his day and rejected others, reshaping everything that fell under his
                touch in that pragmatic ap- proach to meter so characteristic of the Romantics.

                contrastive stress, which Hollander examines in detail. More interesting still: "the

                metrical composition in a language." </notes>

            <notes> Browning fits his metrical style to the subject not to the genre, and he seems
                discordant at times because, unlike other poets who usually exploit the possi-
                bilities for cacophony--metrical variation, articulatory difficulty, and syntactic
                breaks within the line--only in one dimension, while compensating for it in the
                other two, Browning usually provides no compensation to smooth out the intensities
                of his expressive dissonance. </notes>

                163-92.</bib>
            <notes> Actually, "Blake's Epic Rhythm": Kumbier employs musical notation for "rhythmic
                scansion." Blake's verse shows rudiments of a formulaic style, both lexically and
                metrically, and K. sets semantically correlate passages from the various Prophetic
                Books alongside each other to show three types of repeti- tion--verbatim, adaptive,
                and complex--and the nature of Blakean meter, which is "a meter of interruption, a
                highly controlled interruption, though, whereby the contesting metrical voices are
                brought into the sharpest possible contrast, often with remarkable economy." Can
                such be a meter? It is not the foot or the line that is the metrical unit, K.
                argues, but this metrically formu- laic phrase; indeed, the distinctive feature of
                the scansions here is that they change time signatures within the line very
                frequently, K. claiming a change of meter within a change of rhythm. (This seems
                extreme.) Finally, he argues that Blake's statement in the Preface to Jerusalem that
                "the terrific numbers are re- served for the terrific parts--the mild &amp; gentle
                for the mild &amp; gentle parts, and the prosaic for the inferior parts: is fully
                justified so long as no one-to-one correspondence of metric mode to meaning is
                expected. the modes are com- plexly interpermeated. In any event, the pre-eminent
                mode of the Prophetic Books, the "mild &amp; gentle," is a manifestation of the
                limited vision of Beulah, hence unreliable. K's suggestion that caesura determines
                meter is a novelty. </notes>

                show that Lamia is much closer to the earlier Endymion than to anything in Dryden;

                of "secondary accent" here explicitly, giving a full account in Chapter Two after a
                review of Donne criticism in the first. The third chapter (half the book) presents
                Melton's thesis: the stylistic idiosyncrasy which he finds to mark Donne's
                versification indelibly is the repetition of the same word usually in the same line
                but with opposite stress (first stressed, then unstressed, or vice versa): this
                feature he calls "arsis- thesis variation." Dense complexes of such words occurring
                close together turn out to be very frequent in Donne. </notes>

                the influence of Elizabeth Bishop, the later style represents not a weakening of
                control but rather a suiting of rhythm and rhyme to the sense rather than to a
                tight, formal, abstract pattern. </notes>

            <notes> A piece of plain axiological cogency: "The greater degree of formal regularity
                in Surrey's verse . . . does not make him either a better poet . . . or a worse one
                . . . but first of all a different kind of poet." Wyatt is not a fumbler, and Surrey
                is not monotonous; it is simply that they have antipodal features of character, and
                hence, treatments of the verbal medium. Wyatt exalts individual experience in all
                its rough-ness; he advances himself; he loves conflict, tension; he bends and breaks
                forms to serve his will. Surrey, in contrast, values smoothness, "sweetness"; he
                prefers the submission of self in the embracing bonds of convention, the controlling
                artifice of pattern; he approves of order, resolution, law. In short, Wyatt and
                Surrey are the paradigms for two types of poet: "smooth lyric poets . . . whose
                music tends to control and contain their meaning, and rough lyric poets . . . who
                make form obey matter." </notes>

                erratic but simply richly diverse, and coherent: Tennyson worked in three major
                metrical modes simultaneously--the irregular ode forms (mainly four-stress lines;
                very ornate), stanzaic forms (the early ones spectacular, the later simpler but more
                durable), and sustained forms (essentially the mature, musical, but grave and

                versification yet written, Ostriker's book places Blake's two poetic modes, the
                short lyric and the long prophecy, in the context of both conservative and
                rebellious eighteenth-century verse- systems (couplet and blank) as a prelude to
                examining the metrics and sonics of his major poems. See especially chapters 5 and
                6. Methodologically, however, the work staggers and totters: Ostriker firmly
                distinguishes meter (pattern) from rhythm (realization) yet then pro- ceeds to use
                "basically Saintsbury's foot-scansion," marking stresses but assum- ing that "the
                structural basis of verse is the sense of regular recurrence in time." Most of the
                time only two degrees of stress are marked. This is a ground- breaking survey; we
                await now a concrete foundation. </notes>

                fifteen permissible variations, the most dis- putable being the "monosyllabic foot
                after caesura" (arguments for alternatives are reviewed). Compares Wyatt's practice
                to that of Chaucer, Lydgate, Barclay, and Skelton to establish the existence of a
                tradition. Scansions of six sonnets conclude. </notes>

            <notes> Based on Yeats's interest in song-verse, his MSS scansions and notes, and his
                reading of Thomas MacDonagh (E302), P. concludes that his major metrical mode was
                stress verse, not foot verse, with some regularity of syllables as well, producing a
                loose, "mixed" metric wherein lines could be acceptable by either stress- or
                syllable-count. But Yeats's prosodic range was extraordinary, as wit- nessed by his
                command of tight stanzaic forms and formalized off-rhyme. </notes>

            <notes> Examination of metrical variations and idiosyncratic forms of syntax reveals a
                fairly clear division between the prophecies of 1788-94, wherein Blake was
                interested primarily in the possibilities of the fourteener, and those of 1794-95,
                where his interest turned to developing a "double syntax" correspondent to his wider
                double vision. The syntactic features most of interest are the use of a word to
                modify the words both preceding and succeeding it, and the equating of two words to
                a third, whereby they become equilibrated to each other. </notes>

            <notes> In view of the general critical opinion of the fragmentary nature of "Kubla
                Khan," the poem is surprising in light of its great lack of metrical irregularity.
                The organization of line-lengths and rhyme schemes is very tight and orderly,
                suggesting that the poem is more complete and less fragmentary than it seems.

                else becomes an even longer octameter. Dictum: "In his use of the long line [Blake]

            <notes> Based on his dissertation at the University of Birmingham in 1961. In chapter 10
                on "Harmony of Numbers" Southall makes caustic remarks on the work of Foxwell (E990)
                and Padelford (E1034), jeering at their lists of ac- ceptable deviations and,
                indeed, any attempt of "classical prosody" to see Wyatt's lines as iambic
                pentameters. The following chapter explicates the author's own view of "The
                Construction of Wyatt's Verse": Wyatt's line "tends to fall into phrasal units
                separated by pauses, the values of which depend upon the general significance of the
                communication, so that the fundamental char- acter of the rhythm is due to the
                requirements of intonation, a feature that re- ceives no recognition from classical
                prosody." In short, it is a recognizable remnant of the older hemistichic line.
                Southall believes that manuscript punc- tuation (esp. the virgule) was used to
                denote rhythmical phrasing. </notes>

            <notes> The term "harsh" seems to have meant any disappointment or thwarting of the
                verse-reader's expectations, either metrical or semantic. The English Parnassus (see
                E520) offers "sweet" and "harsh" (presumably antithetical) as descriptions for the
                placing of "Accents." </notes>

            <notes> Donne's metrical idiom commonly includes stress-shift (unusually frequent),
                missing syllables at the beginning or end of the line or around the caesural pause,
                the pyrrhic + spondee double foot, elision (required and optional), and allowable

            <notes> It is only by meaning that we will come safely to meter in Donne, and not the
                other way around. His "wrenched accents" are rhetorical and intentional; they reach
                for a higher plane of sense--and art--than that of an invariant, regular meter.

                quasi-accentual verse tradi- tion visible in Wyatt, as in Donne; it is not the same
                tradition that runs, iambi- cally, from Surrey to Spenser. Section 3 focuses on
                Donne as "a conscious master of harshness"; sections 4, 5, and 6 inquire into the
                possibilities for imi- tation or at least reinforcement of sense by sound. </notes>

                able to show that the frequent metrical shifts are motivated by concomitant shifts
                in tone or character much more successfully that he is able to find valid
                descriptors for the meters themselves--are they iambic and anapestic, or tro- chaic
                and dactylic? The labels do not serve well at all here. There is a lesson in this.
