                Clarendon Press, 1965.</bib>
            <notes> In nos. 58-63 Addison defines "false wit," which, as opposed to "true wit,"
                which discerns a surprising resemblance of ideas or of similar features in oth-
                erwise-dissimilar objects (discordia concours), produces a mere similarity of
                letters (anagrams, acrostics), syllables (doggerel rhymes, bouts-rimées), words
                (puns), or "whole sentences or poems, cast into the figures of eggs, axes, or
                altars." In no. 285 (on perspicuity and sublimity of Milton's language), Milton is
                praised for the variety he acheives in his numbers by elisions. No. 39 defends blank
                verse as the proper medium for tragedy. </notes>

            <notes> The student lacking time for a discursive essay should read only section IV,
                where Alexander supports the view that Shakespeare was the sole author, by attacking
                the metrical tests of Spedding, Hickson, and the others, on the grounds that the
                stylistic characteristics claimed to be distinctly Fletcher's in fact occur often in
                the later Shakespeare. But no statistics are given in support. </notes>

            <notes> Banks notes that since nearly half of Milton's sentences end in mid-line, and
                since he uses inversions of accent freely, we should recognize that the "sen- tence
                structure" in the verse is superordinate to the meter (line structure). Re- ply by

            <notes> Two of the nine sections in the book (nos. 2 &amp; 3) are on Shakespeare; the
                in- forming principle is that the style of each play (not isolated passages within
                the plays) is sufficiently distinct from all the rest to allow dating on such
                evidence. Section 2, however, gives mainly only long extracts from the plays;
                section 3 summarizes the general conclusions. </notes>

                Bright in MLN 36 (1921): 63-64; in TLS, 26 February 1920, p. 136. This book draws on
                three earlier articles published in TLS, 23 May-13 June 1918, pp. 242, 265, 277,
                290; discussed in subsequent correspondence by Simpson, Wilson, and O'Neill, pp.
                301, 313, 325, with a summary reply to all three by Bayfield on 1 August, pp.
                361-62. See also Wilson (E411, N136). Bayfield's theory has two principal features:
                he believes that metrical eli- sions were not intended by Shakespeare but were the
                result of house styling for the First Folio; they therefore should be "resolved"
                (i.e., expanded), re- sulting in many trisyllabic feet. (This theory is as queer as
                it sounds, but in fact Saintsbury too thought elisions "hideous.") Second, he
                believes that English verse is actually trochaic rather than iambic--it is only that
                poets regularly add an extra upbeat syllable and drop the requisite final syllable,
                for some reason or other. This view, which is nothing but eccentricity in the finest
                English tradi- tion, is also propounded in E336 and in E1094 "Our Traditional
                Prosody and an Alternative." MLR 13 (1918): 157-82. </notes>

                D. Emma and John T. Shawcross. New York: Frederick Ungar, 1967. pp. 333-68.</bib>
            <notes> The one sharp focus of proper perspective, we remember, is a resultant of fused
                twin perspectives: Beum offers here both (1) a lengthy and careful survey of the
                history of theories about Milton's verse-structure--from Henry John Todd and Dr.
                Johnson to James Whaler and F. T. Prince--emphasizing re- peatedly that it is the
                line as a whole, not the foot ("Milton is not a foot proso- dist") which is the
                metrical unit for Milton, a view for which he need not have gone to the Italians to
                learn; and also (2) a very full characterization of Milton's verse itself, in terms
                of rhymelessness (it offered sublimity, austerity, natural- ness, plasticity,
                dramatic propriety), alliteration and assonance, enjambment (the lines nevertheless
                end on heavy syllables), hypermetrical lines, elision, mellifluousness, strictness,
                and sonority. Beum concludes that "we need not radically revise the traditional
                description of Milton's epic verse" but reasserts his central point: the Miltonic
                line is essentially decasyllabic but not iambic. </notes>

                and Milton after them, never cared at all for the perfect iambic decasyllable:
                "their practice was to distribute the ac- cents almost at will . . . [in] absolute
                freedom." The correspondents, however, take up the Kalevala meter in Longfellow's
                "Hiawatha" and the possibility of Catullian hendecasyllabics in Browning's "One Word
                More." </notes>

            <notes> Marlowe first made the blank-verse line a truly native form and a supple for-
                mal instrument; Brooke analyzes the hallmarks of his metrical style in Tambur-
                laine: the single line as unit and the verse paragraph; octosyllabics, nonasyl-
                labics, and Alexandrines; weak and hypermetrical line-ends; repetitions of phrasing
                and entire lines; and others. These features are then traced through Marlowe's later
                plays up to Edward II; his metrical style develops toward vari- ety, even as the
                lines steadily lose their ornate rhetoric and diction. </notes>

            <notes> Clemen argues that though rhythm is one of the most powerful elements in drama,
                its effects are unconscious and its dramatic functions scarcely under- stood. Thus,
                ordinary naming, counting, and scanning of meter is useless. Be- sides stress,
                pitch, tempo, tone-color, volume, and ease of articulation are im- portant, as well
                as diction, register, rhetoric, and dramatic delivery. Lichten- hahn, an actor, adds
                that technical knowledge of Shakespeare's versification is crucial for the actor's
                interpretation, though beyond that point the sheer power in the lines can be
                harnessed only by rhythmic stylization. He cites three ex- amples in Lear where
                verse-technique creates character. </notes>

            <notes> Cobb's argument that Shakespeare's lines are actually read (temporally speak-

                assumption that "a line is in no particular meter until it has been read" is simply
                false. Neither of these may be inferred from the fact that many pen- tameter lines
                have only four lexical stresses. Temporalist metrics: see E284 and E285. </notes>

                caesura, occasional extra syllables, and monosyllables to slow down the rhythm--to
                achieve variety within the traditional constraints. In comparison the
                verse-paragraphing, syntax, and diction are relatively direct. </notes>

                Oxford University Press, 1965. pp. 398-415. Rhythmically Milton's great
                accomplishment is PL was to create "a strong- ribbed structure of accents [which]
                constantly buoys up line by line the mighty periods. . . . by assigning all [the]
                accents nearly equal value. . . . each succes- sively primary." This sustentation of
                an elevated voice is the exact opposite of the effect in PR, where the leveling of
                accents works as gradation ("the syllabic pattern keeps the accents from being
                pronounced, and the accents keep the syllabic pattern from being incantatory"),
                while in SA the equipoised accents create a "rhythmic indeterminacy" wherein every
                line has two or more possi- ble readings (and scansions) simultaneouly. </notes>

            <notes> The description of later Miltonic blank verse given by Bridges in Milton's Pros-
                ody (E491) is here confirmed for Milton's early poetry as well: it is "regularly
                iambic and decasyllabic," and Milton definitely "scanned his verse in one way and
                read it in another." Thus, throughout all his pentameter verse, whether blank or
                rhymed, Milton scrupulously insures by the strategy of elision that his lines shall
                contain ten and only ten syllables. (The tetrameter verse however is frequently
                heptasyllabic.) There is a regular inverse correlation between date of composition
                and strictness of verse design in Milton; the latest verses are the freest, the
                earliest the tightest. Rhyming and stanza in Lycidas are also exam- ined by
                Diekhoff. </notes>

                lated unit of verse to be indicated as such by some sort of breath pause or lin-
                gering at the end." Diekhoff's view emphasizes the integrity of the line as op-
                posed to the "verse-paragraph" or sentence--i.e. the meter as opposed to the syntax.

            <notes> The interlocutors in Professor Dobrée's essay on dramatic poesie survey the
                whole tradition of blank verse, interpreting its development "histriophoni-
                cally"--as a dramatic instrument, that is--rather more than "prosodically"--in terms
                of rules and permissible substitutions--though the essence of that inter- pretation
                is a theory of three principal stresses to the line and "breath-groups." More
                engaging still is the larger argument that blank verse (the dramatic effect of which
                is speed and fluidity) and dramatic prose (the effect of which is rhythmic
                deceleration and delay) were evolving, in the later Shakespeare, and could still
                evolve into a higher form of "stage-prose," more stylized than common speech, yet
                more supple than the blank-verse line, than even the dramatic medium of The Tempest,
                which was "too subtle . . . too fine for the stage." </notes>

            <notes> Interested in the rhythmic effects of trivial monosyllabic function words, Donow
                sorts the 2,155 lines of the sonnets first by number of words, then also by
                function-word appearance. These 136 words represent only 4% of the total vocabulary
                used in the Sonnets (3,211 words) but account for a surprising 55 % of the actual
                words used. Since the stressing of polysyllables is relatively rigid compared to
                that of monosyllables, lines heavy in the latter will show greater metrical variety.

            <notes> Eliot develops here the earliest part of his famous thesis that blank verse
                achieved its finest form in the Renaissance but withered after Milton--which is that
                Marlowe was the first great master of the form, achieving "the melody of Spenser"

            <notes> In constrast to those identifying Early, Middle, and Late styles, Eliot insists
                on the irrefrangible unity of Shakespeare's development, most importantly in its
                elevation of the natural colloquial language into a more refined arena. A sur- vey
                of Shakespeare's contemporaries reveals how crude their versification was in
                comparison; Shakespeare surpassed them in writing genuine dialogue and in putting
                great art even in the mouths of mean characters. But Shakespeare only became a great
                poet by finding solutions to his dramatic problems, and it is this "inner necessity"
                in the nature of drama which led to the development of his verse, early (King John)
                to late (Pericles). The late plays achieve a profundity and musicality of language
                within dream-worlds where play and ritual are fused. </notes>

            <notes> A curious little book by a working translator on the line-structure, versifica-
                tion, and accidence of Shakespeare's plays. The main thesis seems to be that any
                supposed "irregularities" of meter or punctuation are actually intentional,
                semantically significant directives for stage-business (pauses, emphases). The
                argument rests virtually entirely on the Folio punctuation. </notes>

            <notes> Asserts more succinctly the author's theory that while some lines were halved or
                divided in the First Folio because they were too long for the frame (these broken
                lines will be restored as full long-lines by modern editors), other lines were
                divided in two which would have fitted as one. These must have been di- vided in
                manuscript, Flatter argues, and so the break in versification and white space on the
                page must be understood as denoting a silence on stage during some significant
                action or gesture. One wonders how verse-time could be so precisely equated with
                stage-time. </notes>

            <notes> The first paper applies the metrical tests to Shakespeare, the second to
                Beaumont, Fletcher, and Massinger. Both include Notes, Tables, and extended
                discussion by other members present. In fact, the entire volume for 1874 (Se- ries
                1, Parts 1 and 2) is of interest, with many papers and convoluted discus- sions on
                the dating of the plays in the canon by means of linguistic and metri- cal evidence.

                "Pronunciation and Metre" (pp. 66-72) and an even briefer one (12, pp. 106-9) "On

            <notes> The "new arrangement" is to divide the pentameter lines into semantic units or

                all that grand metrical counterpoint on the grounds that "the difficulties arising
                from the complicated nature of the language, are increased by its distri- bution
                into Lines or Verses of ten syllables in each." Only unmitigated eccen- tricity--or
                ignorance--could hold that the great poem is "no more a succession of distinct
                portions of ten syllables, than if it were ordinary Prose." Forde identifies
                Metrical Verse with solely that which is rhymed. Sixty-two pages of introduction and
                thirty-six pages of sample text. </notes>

            <notes> Starting from a critique of Traditional prosody as "an extremely blunt instru-
                ment" for analyzing verse, Fowler examines very closely the metrical style--
                "texture"--of extracts from Tamburlaine, The Tempest, and The Prelude, so as to
                anatomize and discuss the immensely complex fabric of syntax-and- meter. "A
                distinctive verse texture or metrical style is created. . . where pat- terns of
                syntax and morphology are interwoven with patterns of minor metri- cal
                irregularities, and the scheme so established is repeated to give a cumulative
                effect." Fowler's exposition of "grammetrics" (i.e., syntacti-metrics) is pro-
                vocative and, in a way, traditional. </notes>

                iambic verse-movement helps to convey emotion, but in Lear the common meters were
                not enough, and we note the disappearance of the caesura, the appearance of long
                runs of stresses. It is oppressive to watch grammarians rhapsodizing. </notes>

                being "the form most suitable for secular rational analysis" by the bourgeoisie.

                (imitators of classical meters). The techniques learned from Latin were "en-

                varieties. The Committee concludes that verse-tests may never stand as primary

                varies widely with editions, making such statistics problematic at best. Hart's own
                tabulations on the canon show that Shakespeare consistently used about eight words
                to the blank-verse line, and Hart recommends this figure as a standard for prose
                "lines." </notes>

                ning of this circuitous route to the mind of the reader is an elaborate exercise in
                counterlogic." Why then eschew rhyme, the most counterlogical device of all? (1)
                Other devices were available, such as dislocation in syntax. (2) Milton does
                occasionally rhyme. (3) There is a kind of "pseudo-rhyme" as well-- semantically
                contrasting word-pairs. Milton had "more refined ideas about the way to achieve
                musical delight; his counterlogic is a vastly more subtle affair than a mere tagging
                of verses." </notes>

            <notes> A search of the recorded statements of Milton's contemporaries and the Eliza-
                bethan prosodists about "number" and "quantity" in verse; Koehler concludes (though
                without any clear consensus as support) that "apt Numbers" refers to the use of the
                metrical foot (not merely the count of syllables), and "fit quan- tity" to syllabic
                length, implying thereby Milton's awareness of the available resources of syllabic
                "weight" in the line, yet without implying that he in- tended to write in a
                quantitative metric. Since the final syllable in his lines is frequently "weighted,"
                and since rhymes do occur in PL, Koehler judges that Milton objected not so much to
                the concept of rime as to the narrower, more tediously monotonous couplet rime.

                congru- ence, later plays divergence), but even though he can show that the four
                commonest metrical tests are widely inconsistent, his own chronology for the canon
                is erratic too, placing Pericles too early and Macbeth too late, among other misses.

            <notes> Blank verse poetry prefers Jakobson's "metaphoric" pole in language: its style
                is characterized "by repetition at varying intervals, by succession, and by conti-
                nuity." So, in Milton, repetition provides cohesion over clauses, and enjam- bement
                "carries the reader strongly forward" into the next line. The result is "forward
                contiguous movement." Marshall examines all of the eighteenth- century writers of
                blank verse, showing in a striking manner how each fash- ioned a prosodic instrument
                in his verse for his themes and mood. Word- sworth "re-assimilates" the Miltonic
                style. </notes>

            <notes> Adopting Latham's x a system of scansion (E573), Masson briefly reviews the
                versification of Milton's poems in their chronological order then takes up se-
                riatim Milton's metrical craft and rhyme craft. The meter is of course iambic and
                decasyllabic, 5 x a, but variations are "equivalent," Masson says, to the ideal
                form, and he will allow "a Trochee, a Spondee, or a Pyrrhic, for the Iambus, in
                almost any place of the line." Trisyllabic substitutions in the meter are allowed
                too, in preference to any elision in pronunciation. Alexandrines, feminine endings,
                and caesura placement are also examined. On rhymes, the most novel conclusion is
                that Milton freely used imperfect (off, near) rhymes and dialectal forms. As perhaps
                the best statement of the traditional view of Milton's prosody (on the old
                principles of equivalence and substitution), Masson's essay still bears
                examinination. </notes>

            <notes> Gascoigne's long 1576 poem of social criticism, the first instance of non-

                line of Piers Plowman in regard to: four major stresses, heavy medial cae- sura,
                heavy end-stopping, absence of rhyme (of course), and overt alliteration. The author
                gauges that fully 50% of Gascoigne's 1200 lines fit one of the eight alliterative
                patterns of Piers Plowman. It seems Gascoigne did not entirely know what he was
                doing, or the nature of his metric. </notes>

            <notes> Many modern editions. Milton's decision to employ blank verse for his Epic seems
                based in part on the example of "both Italian and Spanish Poets of prime note" (for
                discussion of possible candidates, see E1121), and in part on his own repugnance to
                Rhyme, it being "no necessary Adjunct or Ornament of Poem or good Verse." The "true
                musical delight" consists only in "apt Numbers, fit Quantity of Syllables, and the
                sense variously drawn out from one Verse into another," not in any "jingling sound
                of like endings." The tone of this brief Preface is more strident than one might
                have expected. </notes>

            <notes> An argument that the rhythm of the "Epitaph" should be distinguished from that
                of the two later companion-pieces, as having its origin not in Shakespear- ean
                aestival songs but in Jonson, who showed that octosyllabics could be writ- ten in
                falling rhythm (Moloney thinks them iambic nevertheless) yet weighty and somber in
                effect, not light or tripping. The critical uncertainty about the meter of the
                "Epitaph's" tetrameters is natural since "Milton mingled octosylla- bles and

            <notes> Keats shows a clear pattern of technical growth inot a "mature severity and
                sparseness of style," while Young shows none. Keats relies more heavily on
                enjambement and couplets, whereas Young uses caesural placement more ef- fectively
                and often. Substituted feet are more common in Keats. Trisyllabic feet, entirely
                absent in Young, occur in the early Keats but not the later. "Keats's technical
                development was toward an increasing use of monosylla- bles." Alexandrines and
                triplets occur only in Lamia. Conclusion: Young seems intent on restraining his
                verse, whereas Keats seems to enjoy rhythmic and melodic variety for its own sake.

                one that only time-periods count in verse--nor will he allow them full weight: a

                of punctuation in the line--over virtually the whole corpus of Renaissance drama,
                with selected additional authors for comparison. The graphs present the frequencies
                (in percentages) of occurrence of pause in each of the nine possible positions in
                the pentameter line; three types of pauses are distinguished: (A-pattern) all pauses
                marked by punctuation. (B-pattern) "strong pauses," marked by punctuation stronger
                than the comma; and (C-pattern) pauses created by a "line-split" between two

                pp. 61-76. The well-known demonstration of Milton's debt in diction and in prosody
                to the sonnets of Della Casa and the verse and dramas of Tasso, besides Spenser. For
                the versification of his great epic Milton learned to forge a weighty but seamless
                meld of diction, syntax, and meter from the sixteenth-century versi sciolti,
                especially in Tasso. But Prince disagrees sharply with Bridges (E491) over the
                mechanism of the prosody, denying that Milton thought of his verses in feet at all.
                The whole concept of the metrical foot was a product of the late Renaissance
                Humanist revival of learning; Dante and Tasso, earlier, speak only of length of line
                and rhyme as the elements of verse. The rhyme-patterns of the choruses of Samson
                Agonistes take their origin, Prince concludes, in the dramas of Tasso, Guarini, and
                Andreini, the rhythms, in elaborations and ex- tensions of analogues to the Italian
                hendecasyllable, in Spenser's November ec- logue, and in the self-confidence and
                virtuosity Milton had gained in writing Paradise Lost. Altogether the prosody of PL
                is based on rhyme even though it dispenses with rhyme, in that Milton preserves in
                the final word in the line a gravity, a full measure, a weightiness which remains
                even though the sounds no longer jingle. </notes>

                Tables, 209-14. </bib>
            <notes> A thorough metrical analysis of the 2155 lines of the Sonnets produces useful
                generalizations about (1) trochaic substitutions [that is what metrical variation in
                Shakespeare comes down to, finally] and (2) rhyme and sound-patterning, these
                conclusions being weakened only by some arguable scansions and a no- tation system
                deserving one more sweep of Occam's Razor. Findings: trochees (5% of the 10,761 feet
                here) occur in all five feet in the pentameter line (under constraints set by five
                Metrical Rules which Ramsey stipulates), even split across the caesura; there are 56
                "pyrrhic-spondee combinations" and 21 un- metrical feet in the Sonnets; 7-12% of the
                lines have feminine endings; both discrepancies in terminal consonants of rhyming
                syllables and also identical rhymes were quite acceptable to the age; many
                off-rhymes occur; and the sheer amount of internal rhymes and general sound
                patterning is astonishing. See also the Appendix (E1282) and Index (passim).

            <notes> Had Robert Bridges written on Shakespeare instead of Milton (E491), he would
                have produced something like this study of pronunciation, meter, and elision in the
                pentameter line. The problem is extra syllables and three posi- tions have been
                taken: (1) they count both for pronunciation and in the meter; (2) they should be
                pronounced but not counted metrically; and (3) they do not exist and deserve
                neither. Making some telling points against the prevalent second ("semielision")
                position, Ramsey concludes, from textual evidence, remarks by Puttenham and others,
                and doublets, that Shakespeare intended "a strict disyllabism" in his metrical feet.

            <notes> Follows Conrad (E1125). R. suggests the better term "dove-tailing" for the line
                split between two dramatic characters, in preference to "broken verse" or "shared
                verse." He gives a critical review of the methods of earlier workers using this
                characteristic to date the plays: Conrad's original study simply counted
                occurrences; Pulling analyzed the types of breaking without specific attention to
                this type; König was interested only in where the end of the first speech fell in
                the line; Hereford misunderstood König; and Chambers treated only the pentameter.
                Reinhold's method is to set the total number of broken verses over the number of
                dovetailings (change-in-speaker), giving a percent- age. Application to all the
                major Renaissance dramatists. </notes>

            <notes> Not a strict metrical analysis but rather a broader approach to rhythmic play in
                the verse. Sedlak adopts some of the terminology of Wolfgang Kayser and John Draper
                in order to differentiate between an earlier "linear style" and a later "overflowing
                style" in "flowing" and "rushing" rhythms. He also treats of the relation of meter
                to syntax (or colon to line) and of the variations of meter against the iambic
                pentameter norm for rhythmic effect: hovering stresses, overweighting, and
                endstopping retard the tempo of the verse, while slurring, extra slacks,
                enjambements, feminine endings, and short cola accelerate its tempo. </notes>

                leading to one narrow but irrefragable conclusion and several others, by
                implication, much more important. Sipe, in an effort to discriminate purely lexical
                from metrically influenced lexical choices in Shakespeare's lines, searches the
                74,817 lines of the canon for "syllabic variants" (i.e. doublets, words
                etymologically related or synonymous, varying only in number of syllables, e.g.
                against vs. 'gainst). Such variants appear in 12,814 lines, of these only 63 % (.5%)
                show a usage in spite of the meter. Conclusion: "Shakespeare was in fact greatly
                con- cerned about preserving the regularity of his verse. . . . [and] chose
                particular word-forms with metrics in mind." Even neologism seem to have been formed
                partly so as to fit the meter. This study should be the complete anti- dote to those
                turn-of-the-century aberrations about Shakespearean trochaic meter, trisyllabic
                substitutions, and unreliable orthography. See also Kökeritz (E1228). </notes>

                insists that "dramatic blank verse is quite different from non-dramatic, and the two

                Verse," and "The Blank Verse of Milton." Symonds has been sometimes dismissed if not
                damned by later prosodists for adopting the "intuitive" approach, since prosodists,
                fanatical about precision of statement and detail, abhor anything that smacks of
                impressionism; Omond's virulent characterization of Symonds' methods as amounting,
                "practically, to a negation of prosody," is both spiteful and undeserved. In fact
                Symonds' slim little volumne has been continuously quoted and approved, due mainly I
                think to the surprisingly fresh yet acute discussion of Accent and Quantity in the
                first chapter. His critics were foolish to believe that "non-technical" means "not
                ac- curate" or even "not useful." The historical survey of B. V. extends from
                Sackville &amp; Norton to Tennyson. See Mayor (E592), Chapter 4; Omond (A5), p. 186,

            <notes> Attacking critics such as David Masson and Charles Witcomb for refusing eli-
                sions in the Miltonic line, Thomas frames an argument that Milton consis- tently
                wrote absolute decasyllabic lines on the foundations of that line in Old French,
                Italian, Middle English, and Renaissance versification and on known
                seventeeth-century conventions of pronunciation and stressing. Fixity of sylla-
                ble-count, in short, Thomas claims to be the sole inviolable law of Milton's
                versification; Milton did not conceive of his decasyllable as an iambic one, since
                he often has more than five stresses, sometimes contiguous stresses, or fre- quently
                two inversions in a line, but it was a five-stress line, since Milton also followed
                "the law of a minimum quantity of accents." The third installment takes up variation
                in pause-placement both at mid- and end-of-line, and pho- netic harmonies. See
                replies by Omond and others at E1265. </notes>

            <notes> In Dialogue 1, Eugenio upholds the advantages of blank verse over rhyme, then
                turns to censure excessive sound-patterning in verse, stopping along the way to
                praise and illustrate Shakespeare's versification, the sweetness of which lies in
                its making high artifice seem nothing but natural; yet, Shakespeare "in- tended it
                to be nothing more than a measured or musical prose; except, when he meant to rise
                to his Subject, or give a distinction to a thought; and then we shall always trace
                in his numbers the influence of his feelings." Of sound: it is a fault "to suffer
                any one letter . . . to govern entirely" a passage of verse. it is equally a fault
                to believe too literally that the sound must seem an echo to the sense: "the sounds
                should be always in accord with the sense, but they should accompany, not mimic it."

            <notes> Yardi tries to improve upon the nineteenth-century work on metrical tests by a
                rigorous statistical analysis, but--astoundingly--he takes his data on feminine
                endings, split lines, and pauses directly from Fleay and Chambers (and thus their
                outdated editions). The conclusions confirm the accepted order. Such work generally
                fails because the researcher must be expert in (1) Elizabethan theatrical practice;
                (2) the textual history of the Folio; (3) statistics; and (4) metrics. Work based on
                faulty texts is worthless a priori. See also: B40, B44, C3, C8-9, C17, C27, C200,

                Regularity in verse, but in fact Variety also counted: only 57% of the lines in this

                four prominent stresses. Other features analyzed: caesura- placement, end-of-line

            <notes> Based on his dissertation at Syracuse University. In the first section Alssid
                defends Dryden's use of rhyme in drama from the criticisms of Harley
                Granville-Barker by adapting a political analogy: rhyme, as monarch, gives order and
                law to the verse and rivets ("usurps") the attention of the audience, reminding them
                of the fictiveness of the aesthetic artiface. In the second he shows how Dryden
                derived, from the early nondramatic couplets of "Upon the Death of Lord Hastings,"
                "Astrea Redux," and "Verses to Her Highness the Duchess," a dramatic couplet that
                was (1) more varied in meter, (2) simplified in syntax and rhetoric, and (3)
                mitigated in repetitiveness by triplets, Alexandrines, etc. The three poems receive
                very close analysis. </notes>

                verse-structure, in preference to Pope's. Churchill's run-on couplet was further
                loosened by the influence of the rhythms of Shakespearean blank verse. </notes>

                breath-points, often ends with strong verbs, adopts the "epithetic" style of giving
                every noun an adjective; he allows himself an "uncompensated, unemphatic accent" at
                times in the third foot (otherwise termed "pyrrhic" by some; he rarely elides

            <notes> Iconoclasm: Carruth argues that Pope "did everything he could, within the strict
                couplet, to relieve the jig-jog of standard pentameter"--i.e. (1) he used the
                apostrophe for all sorts of stylistic effects, and quite inconsistently, but never
                for mere metrical elision, because hiatus does occur in Pope's verse; (2) he used
                weak syllables in ictic position and, later, runs of up to three stresses followed
                by three slacks to break the iambic drone; and (3) he considered the couplet not as
                an "artificial" verseform but as "nearest prose," hence exhibiting, more than
                anything else, naturalness and "freedom from padding." In the early Pope, as Carruth
                shows in a brilliant demonstration, pentameters can be easily "translated" into
                tetrameters, but in the mature Pope no padding is allowed at all: every word pulls
                its weight. </notes>

            <notes> Butler's satiric intent is undercut by his own metrical incompetence. He appar-
                ently accepted "the restrictions of conservative theories" of prosody for his own
                verse-making, while he "repeatedly and violently" attacked them through his
                narrator. There are clear prosodic indications that Butler was "pretending to
                metrical regularity," yet his counterpointing of the metrical and rhythmic stresses
                is consistently imcompetent. The result is "a prosodic situation that is awkward,
                grotesque, and bathetic." And thus the polarizing of readers' re- sponses to
                Hudibras is explained: readers who recognize the stumbling rhythm find it "jolting";
                those who cannot, but hear only the metrical norm under- neath, find it "jogging."

            <notes> The "Epistle Dedicatory of The Rival Ladies" [1664] defends the use of rhyme,
                taking Waller as authority and precedent (see vol. 1, pp. 5-8). This was an- swered
                by Sir Robert Howard, in the Preface to his Plays [1665]; Dryden countered with the
                indomitable Of Dramatick Poesie, an Essay [1668] (see vol. 1, pp. 89-107); Howard
                tried to rally in the Preface to his The Great Favorite, or, The Duke of Lerma
                [1668]; Dryden fired the final volley in "A Defense of an Essay of Dramatic Poesy,"
                prefixed to the second edition of his The Indian Em- peror [1668] (vol. 2, pp.
                113-18). Aureng-zebe [1676]; by the way, was the last play Dryden wrote in rhyme
                (couplets). From the Rival Ladies preface comes the famous remark that the verse
                must serve as the "clogs" for the "high-ranging Spaniel" of the imagination. "The
                great easiness of blank verse renders the poet too luxuriant; he is tempted to say
                many things, which might better be omitted, or at least shut up in fewer words; but
                when the difficulty of artful rhyming is interposed . . . the fancy then gives
                leisure to the judgment to come in, which, seeing so heavy a tax imposed, is ready
                to cut off all unnecessary expense." This is Dryden's reply to those who think rhyme
                "only an embroidery of sense." In the Essay of Dramatick Poesie, Crites attacks the
                use of rhyme in plays (though he will allow them in poetry) on the grounds that the
                drama follows Nature, and of course there is no natural rhyming in Speech. Neander
                (Dry- den) replies on a variety of fronts: dramatic language, he observes, is
                height- ened over that of everyday speech, so rhyme is appropriate to the stage. And
                the pressure of the formal constraints forces the verse-making poet to think ahead,
                thereby sharpening his wits. Rhyme is equally proper for plays as for poetry; it
                "might be made as natural as blank verse by the well placing of the words, etc. All
                the difference between them when they are both correct, is, the sound in one, which
                the other wants." From the Preface to Albion and Albanius [1685]: while the
                recitative part of opera "requires a more masculine beauty of expression and sound,"
                the mu- sic "must abound in the softness and variety of numbers." "And yet there are
                rules . . . and as great a certainty of quantity in our syllables, as either in the
                Greek or Latin. . . ." Double rhymes and a symtax especially formed "for the
                sweetness of the voice" are the "main hinges" on which opera turns. The 1697
                Dedication of Aeneis (vol. 2, esp. pp. 214-34) defends the use of triplets and
                Alexandrines, on the authority of Spenser and Cowley, men- tioning also diction in
                translations. The great difficulty for the imitator of Vir- gil is "his numbers, his
                choice of words, and his placing them for the sweetness of the sound." Dryden
                recommends avoidance of caesura (needed in Latin to temper the lusciousness of
                over-abundant vowels), hiatus, and monosyllabic lines. More vexingly: "I have long
                had by me the materials of an English Proso- dia, containing all the mechnical rules
                of versification, wherein I have treated, with some exactness, of the feet, the
                quantities, and the pauses." Yet, "the evil of false quantities is difficult to be
                cured in any modern language" (pp. 217- 18). In the Preface to Fables Ancient &amp;
                Modern [1700] (vol. 2, esp. pp. 258- 59), Dryden compares Homer to Virgil, then
                asserts (mistakenly) that Chau- cer's meter is often rugged: his verse "is not
                harmonius to us" (though Dryden recognizes that it was not found so in Chaucer's own
                age). See also Dryden's poem "To the Earl of Roscommon," 11. 5-25. </notes>

            <notes> A study of the distortion which the rhyme in couplet verse wreaks upon the
                syntax, especially in the Restoration dramas of Dryden, Lee, Otway, and Crowne.
                Since rhyme words are frequently verbs, and since the most useful form of the verb
                is the infinitive, present- and past-tense verbs are often sup- planted by do/did +
                infinitive. The rhyme may also necessitate splitting an oth- erwise-integral phrase,
                dropping syllables, adding proclitics or enclitics to fill out the line, or dumping
                excess material into the beginning of the following line ("bad enjambement").

            <notes> Admitting the well-known metrical, syntactic, and rhetorical accomplishments of
                the closed couplet, Jones suggests, radically, that in the larger context of the
                poem the couplet form accentually impoverishes the coherence of the whole, by the
                attenuations of elaboration and by reliance on only a single effective mode of
                development--logic. The "play of sensibility" in the verse is thus con- strained.
                Comparing Donne's version of his Satires to Pope's reveals how Donne was able to
                create an "interplay of verse and prose structure," the prose syntax having maximum
                play within the metrical form, whereas in Pope the verse-structure (pace Matthew
                Arnold) entirely subsumes and compels the prose statement. Extraordinary insight

                Over the course of Pope's career his verse decreased slightly its reliance on
                balance for structure, increased slightly its use of the open couplet, and shifted
                from an early tendency to compose in terms of the line to a late tendency to compose
                by the sentence. In many respects the most distinguished example of Pope's
                versecraft is The Rape of the Lock. But balance and closure are primary concerns in
                his verse-architecture throughout. </notes>

            <notes> The argument for the Latin elegaic couplet as the source for the "classical"
                English closed couplet rests on a high degree of similarity between the two in
                end-stopping, metrical regularity, and balance/antithesis. A full survey of the
                couplets written from Chaucer to the 1630's shows that the major develop- ment began
                with Tottel (1557) in translations of Ovid and reached its zenith, in 1590-1610, in
                satire and the epigram; after 1610 the incidence of the open couplet increases under
                the influence of the Tribe of Ben and John Donne. </notes>

            <notes> Based on his dissertation (above). Shannon proposes Grimald as the pioneer in
                the use of the couplet in the early Renaissance. Survey of his works shows that
                Grimald's couplets--his favorite meter--are used mainly for epigrams, elegies, and
                occasional verse, maintain good continuity, show a high degree of closure, employ
                balance and antithesis, and were generally scrupulous about correct rhymes, metrical
                regularity, and aureate diction. Similar statistical surveying shows these
                neoclassical features to be very close to those of Latin elegaic verse (Martial and

            <notes> In comparison with Pope, Dryden was laxer, easier, allowing himself the ex-
                pansiveness of a triplet or Alexandrine whenever it was convenient; Pope however
                adopted the rule making "difficulties overcome more admirable than difficulties
                accommodated." The great advantage of the couplet as a form is its greater control
                of the reader's attention, since the reader knows the poet is re- sponsible for each
                one of the twenty syllables in every line. The early Pope concerned himself (in the
                letter to Walsh) with mimetic sound and modal verbs; the mature Pope preferred
                monosyllables--usually one of them a verb-- as rhymes, emphasized the importance of
                balance as a structural principle, and perfected the disposition of the weighty and
                unexpected polysyllable within the line. </notes>

            <notes> A classic study in the development of the couplet form, which resulted from a

                rhyme and a rhetorical-syntactic tradition encouraging parallelism, bal- ance, and
                antithesis. The great linchpin in the line is Ben Jonson; beside him, Waller is a
                "consolidator" rather than an innovator, whose main achievement was to shift the
                matter of the couplet from the paradox of (metaphysical )wit to the sharp bite of

                lines by the use of consecutive weak syllables, the employment of half-stresses both
                singly and in combination with the weaks, and of course the disposition of the
                caesural pause. Wyld also examines the hypothesized retardation of the line by
                consonants and monosyllables, concluding that (1) short consonants either singly or
                in groups do not impair speed, whereas (2) long consonants, singly or in pairs,
                groups of three or more consonants, and any consonantal clusters where rapid
                shifting of the tongue is required do retard the line, though (3) two monosyllables
                are not a priori any harder (slower) to pronounce than a dissyllable--slowness
                depends not on word-boundaries but on phonetic patterns. See also: B212, C231, C236,
