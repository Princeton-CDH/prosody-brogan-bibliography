            <notes> Part 1 treats Grammar, Part 2 (sections 452–515) Prosody. Abbott's textbook
                gives the standard account of the structure of Elizabethan English as well as the
                traditional foot-verse description of the iambic pentameter. But N.B.: Abbott's
                "rules" are supple enough to yield to almost any construing of the meter one might
                make, and his scansions are exceedingly unreliable. He allows monosyl- labic and
                trisyllabic feet, and feet composed of a rest (sec. 508), and he will ex- pand or
                contract syllables shamelessly to fill up a foot. Superseded by Franz (F66, F67).

            <notes> Wordsworth had "a tendency to use full or expanded forms of syntax," the chief
                of which is of + noun phrase, to express possession, instead of apostrophe + s. This
                form tends to slow down the tempo of a passage and provide psychic distancing,
                effects which are jointly the principal determiners of that mood of "reflectiveness"
                so frequent and so central in Wordsworth. In other passages, such as those of direct
                narration or excitement, the form practically disappears. For metrical reasons, the
                form frequently occurs at the beginning of the line. </notes>

                'Adonais': An Exercise in Stylistic Criticism." PTL 4 (1979): 315–43. </bib>
            <notes> Passages in the critically admired "Adonais" show the same three types of vio-
                lations of syntactic constraints (the Tensed S Condition, Up-to-Ambiguity
                Constraint, and Center-Embedding), producing convoluted, awkward, even ungrammatical
                lines, that passages in the critically denigrated Laon and Cythna show, the
                difference being that in the latter case the violations are "repeated and
                consistent," whereas in the former they appear solely in the first twenty stanzas of
                the fifty-five stanza poem, i.e. precisely in the passage where Shelley portrays the
                world that is "untransmuted by poetic vision." In "Adonais" he controlled and turned
                to expressive use a technique hitherto uncontrolled. This essay is too long by half,
                but the section on the ambiguity of NP-NP-V constructions as lines of verse is
                enlightening. </notes>

                a "mirror-image" syntactic feature in Coleridge, triads and syntactic "contortion"

                correlated to particular thematic elements in the passages in which they occur:
                symbolic landscape in Coleridge, elegiac adoration in Shelley, and satire in Byron.

                divided into two groups roughly sixty years apart, reveals that the characteristic
                late- Victorian modes of syntactic articulation are dislocation and elaboration,
                while the characteristic early-twentieth-century mode is fragmentation. A closer
                scrutiny is given to the contrastive styles of Hopkins and Yeats and the com-
                parable ones of Browning and Eliot. </notes>

            <notes> Yeats was "not a syntactic innovator, he was a master of syntax," as Barton
                shows, moving through an analysis that is "grammatical rather than linguistic" and
                that keeps close to the individual poems themselves. A traditional method
                appropriate for a poet traditional in syntax. </notes>

                studies of verb tense and mood (mainly the interesting Sub- junctive), pronouns
                (mainly the second-person familiar form), and prepositions in English poetry from
                medieval drama to T. S. Eliot, with full-chapter studies on Shakespeare, Keats, and
                Shelley. In contrast to the many later linguistic studies of poetic grammar--highly
                technical, very narrow, self-conscious of theory and method--Berry's approach is
                best termed speculative: his forte is his delicate yet incisive thinking into the
                implications and the assumptions behind grammatical forms and specific grammatical
                usages. </notes>

                13–25. </bib>
            <notes> Poetic inversions are of two types--stanzaic inversions for metrical compliance
                and displacement inversions for foregrounding--for two purposes--order and
                marking--and via two means--verb or auxiliary shift, or noun-phrase inversion.
                Bivens shows that "the extent to which poetic inversion obeys the rules of or-
                dinary language . . . is not generally appreciated" by mapping out the trans- forms.
                But more importantly, his study avoids the gaudy, ephemeral, and idiosyncratic in a
                steady and patient search for basic principles, such as "the larger question of how
                new and old information is distributed within the sen- tence" [this has applications
                in scansion] and the rather amazing effects of the Traces Convention proposed by

            <notes> One important aspect of the phrasal style in English poetry identified by Jose-
                phine Miles is the poets' "disposition to convert verbs into noun-modifying parti-
                ciples," thereby gaining themselves the compression and ambiguity inherent in such
                constructions. Milton's practice is here compared to that of the other major English
                poets in a nearly model study which demonstrates again how much can be shown about
                poetic effects by attention to only a single device. </notes>

                Critical Quarterly 19 (1977): 31–39. In the first full-length monograph on the
                subject, Davie examines the views of T. E. Hulme (syntax is unnecessary in poetry),
                Susanne Langer (syntax like music traces the form of experience), and Fendlosa
                (syntax symbolizes action), finding them all unsatisfactory; he then produces a
                typology of his own: syntax may be subjective (it shows us the form of the author's
                thought), dramatic (the form of someone else's thought), objective (the form of an
                experience or emo- tion), like music (showing us the form of a thought without
                defining it), or like mathematics (it can give pleasure in and of itself).
                Applications follow in several very short and eclectic studies. </notes>

            <notes> In an intrepid performance, Davie shows that although Miltonic syntax is ca-
                pable of spectacular mimesis on occasion, leading the reader to a meaning by
                enacting it, in general neither the syntax nor the narrative structure itself in PL
                is designed to propel the reader forward or sustain his interest; indeed, "the
                splendidly elaborate syntax . . . in fact is employed characteristically to check
                narrative impetus and frustrate musical pleasure." Hence the "unifying struc- ture"
                of the poem is neither syntactic nor narrative, nor can it be "musical" in the sense
                of music as a structure of expectation and resolution--i.e. sustained
                progression--in time; rather, "it is a matter of vocal colouring and skillful reso-
                nance. . . . the 'music delight' is all in sonority." </notes>

                (deployment of a word for effect), imitative (the syntax forcing the reader to enact
                what is being described), and prosodic (to effect a rhyme, con- form to meter, or

                rather, the competence which speakers show in interpreting poetic lines is "like
                learning a language," or better, like learning "an unfamiliar dialect of one's own
                language": "one seeks to discover regularities which imply rules which one has not
                yet internalized as a part of one's linguistic competence." This heuristic skill is
                thus simply a capacity to "LOOK FOR NEW STRUC- TURE in general." Cf. Aarts (F1).

                passage, they usually try to surmount it by paying attention to lexical meanings or
                logical structure, but rarely by paying attention simply to syntax. He catches
                Kenneth Burke at this, and then gauges the skills of several other critics of
                Thomas's "Altarwise by Owl-light," giving a close reading himself. </notes>

            <notes> It was by crossing the limen, from "words alone" as "certain good" to a search
                for "the syntax of passionate speech," that Yeats elevated his work above that of
                every other poet of his generation. "Among School Children" is a poem which
                "explores a set of dualities in search of some fruitful and integrating vi- sion."

            <notes> Complaining that Geoffrey Leech (F123) is short-sighted in refusing to allow
                semantics and context to affect judgments of grammaticality (deviance), Greenfield
                cites examples to show that the (syntactic) ellipsis of one element in a sentence
                can generate the possibility of ambiguity in other elements, which, lacking such a
                deletion, would otherwise not be open to multiple meaning. So the deletion of on in
                Hopkins' "fastened [on] me flesh" creates such an ambi- guity, a "phonological
                ellipsis," namely "fashioned me flesh." In effect syntactic compression allows
                phonological expansion which enhances semantic richness. </notes>

                linguists since 1960, those of S. R. Levin (B129) and J. McH. Sinclair (F197).
                Greenfield wishes to show that pure linguistic description is useless without
                critical selectivity, and that grammatical analysis cannot produce meaning in the
                absence of lexical-contextual-semantic analysis as well. </notes>

            <notes> Argues that Stevens' poetry is in fact metapoetry (poetry about poetry), and
                hence it must consist primarily of "concepts about poetic language itself, of which
                grammar makes up a large part of the story." That is why Stevens' later poetry is so
                incredibly dense in nouns and adjectives--reifiers and descriptors--and nearly
                devoid of strong verbs. His close repetitions of a word or phrase can usually be
                explicated if we assume a shift in meaning in the second instance. </notes>

            <notes> Proposes two types of syntactic deviation in poetry, both of them relatively
                slight in terms of distortion of the normal grammar yet capable of considerable
                range and also capable of differentiating for us coherent poetic strategies from
                random and unintelligible poetic "cryptograms": in the one type, normal syn- tactic
                processes are simply carried to an unexpected extreme; in the other, an unexpected
                word has been substituted for a familiar one. Both types may be explicated by
                searching for the underlying "immediate source sentence"--i.e., the normal
                nondeviant form. </notes>

            <notes> The iconic text for illustration of the full array of effects possible in
                enjambe- ment is of course Paradise Lost. Hollander formalizes some earlier
                suggestions by devising a graded continuum of the cuts into syntax made by
                enjambment, ranked from "hardest" (worst dislocation, as between determiner and
                noun) to "softest," (respectively) six to one numerically. Determinations of
                hardness, however, are complex matters, given the syntactic ambiguities which Milton
                systematically exploits at line-end: we have learned very well how a following line
                can force a revision of the semantic construal tentatively made at the end of the
                previous line. Such "revisionist" cuts are other than what they seem. Behind this
                article there is a very good book waiting to be written. </notes>

            <notes> Varieties of Syntax as structure: • Tennyson: gorgeous words displayed within a

                Mallarmé: the complex unfolding of subordinations ordering and routing our
                perceptions; • Yeats: calculated syntactic deceptions and feints. But the relevant
                facts or images of the poem may be held in place also by meter, or by the repetition
                and variation of "musical" motifs. With these examples in co-ordination, Kenner
                constructs his marvelously instructive and graceful sketch of Post-Symbolist poetic

                terested in the philosophical assumptions underlying the whole concept that language
                "represents" reality. Korg argues that "language that is occupied with the
                self-conscious investigation of its own properties cannot also be referen- tial";
                indeed, "the most referential language is that which adheres to conven- tion," and
                in as much as the poet "amplifies the corporeality of his language, he actively

                in one case that is too strong to a claim, in another too weak. A better strategy
                would be to introduce into the grammar a device which "scrambles" the elements of

            <notes> Syntactic deviations in poetry are of two types: "those produced against the
                conventions of the poem." The first type, which Riffaterre has treated in terms of
                microcontext and macrocontext, is not a satisfactory concept, nor is the second if
                it approached purely statistically, since statistical norms for syntax in the lan-
                guage as a whole are simply impracticable. "But not all ungrammatical se- quences
                are poetically deviant . . . poetic deviation is in some sense controlled." Hence
                the standard for deviation should be the determinate norm of a genera- tive grammar
                of the language. </notes>

                of characters in the poems virtually always correlates with syntactic complex- ity;
                (3) the most syntactically complex poems are the celebratory ones; (4) the satires
                are nearly all in the middle style; (5) in poems where lament suffuses joy, joy
                dominates at least in terms of syntactic complexity; and (6) Spenser shows a
                remarkable range of complexity in syntax. </notes>

                the relative degree of syntactic complexity in "Sordello," which turns out to be
                "not uniform, nor even major in the poem." In quantitative density, specific
                features do not occur so very frequently compared to other stylists such as Gibbon,
                Johnson, or Swift, though in the relationships among specific features, some
                passages in the poem do score highly. </notes>

            <notes> A review of the whole issue of grammatical deviance in poetry. "In the realm of
                highly deviant expression . . . given the idiosyncratic and non-formalizable nature
                of poetic deviance, it is likely that generative grammars will be at best
                irrelevant, and at worst misleading. . . . Additional models . . . are called for .
                . . ." The crux of the problem, Lipski concludes, is that "when faced with an
                instance of severe grammatical deviance, the listener makes use of a set of pre-
                grammatical strategies for arriving at the basic semantic structure." </notes>

            <notes> Implicitly or explicitly syntax has always been a part of English verse-theory,
                especially for Old English, but even "where a metrical principle is not percep-
                tible, as in most modern verse, the description and definition of rhythms be- comes
                impossible unless we take grammar into consideration." Earlier proso- dists offer
                little help, though Scripture's "centroid" captures the idea of the
                phrase-coalescing stress. Probably enjambement is only a matter of degree, every
                line having at least some minimal pause at its end. Mitchell gives a ten- tative
                sketch of a taxonomy for English verse (pp. 18–19), with illustrations. </notes>

            <notes> In their metrical pattern, Cowper's heroic couplets "imply the analytic mode [of
                conceiving experience] while his syntax implies the constructive." (In comparison
                with Pope, Cowper tends to modify the whole assertion rather than merely the
                subject.) It was this uncongeniality of the couplet to Cowper's modi cogitandi which
                impelled his toward blank verse. (In comparison with Wordsworth, Cowper's blank
                verse is much more argumentative and dialectic.) F156 See also this author's

            <notes> Recent analyses of the syntax of the poem by Donald Freeman (F68) and Geoffrey
                Hartmann find what they set out to find, as does the present analysis offered as a
                counter-view. The trouble with Freeman's analysis is that is de- taches parallel
                grammatical constructions from the stanza in order to point up their equivalence in
                the grammatical deep structure, thereby obliterating the fact that "the parallel
                phrases present themselves in various positions upon a material [metrical] field,"
                i.e. the stanza. "A viable concept of poetic syntax must, in other words, include
                metrical information." Patterson's own reading of the Ode is a negative, ironic
                reading. </notes>

            <notes> It is the road to syntax which leads to the palace of Augustan poetry. The
                methods of New Criticism have proved much less efficacious for Augustan poetry than
                for Romantic and Modern, perhaps because the former is with states. With a sharper
                instrument the critic can effect, Rodway demonstrates, some very fine
                discriminations even on very small samples: what emerges to the eye is the
                (syntactic) neural lattice of the Augustan "aesthetic of the intel- lection."

            <notes> Elegantly, Robert contravenes most of our easy assumptions about the syntax of
                the couplet. Since structures of identity (stasis) such as repetition, parallel-
                ism, balance, and antithesis are inherent in the mode, Pope often works against the
                easier effects, creating for example "pseudo-parallelism" and "pseudo- antithesis,"
                structures whose actual effect is exactly the opposite of what it seems. The essence
                of the couplet is a "serial form" with "constant progres- sion." More generally, two
                modes of poetic organization may be defined, "open syntax" and "closed syntax," the
                open form emphasizing objects, things, quiddities, nouns, the closed form conversely
                attentive to connections, change, process (this the Augustan mode). </notes>

            <notes> Does epistemology determine grammar in Blake? There is visual direction, and
                then there is grammatical direction. But directionality in both cases is anything
                but simple: an engraver might be expected to be sensitive to visual reversals, and
                images can be "read" in several configurations, but a word can be modified in
                several directions simultaneously, and in fact words often have "an internal order
                of meaning independent of the horizontal flow of the sentence." Lan- guage too is
                susceptible of reversal, and of multiple directionality. Finally, neither syntax nor
                image partakes of "single vision" in Blake: "The design of vision has no natural
                setting any more than it has anything to do with natural religion." </notes>

            <notes> "The characteristic sound in Stevens' poetry depends to a surprising extent upon
                a single thing: the capacity for complex syntax . . . . The phenomenon is a matter
                of the most exquisite balances, for the parts are at once immediate yet surprising,
                while the whole is simultaneously complex and satisfying. This dramatic balance
                gives Stevens a superb aesthetic instrument, for he can vary its effect almost
                endlessly by shifting complexity from design to detail and sim- plicity from detail
                to design . . . . Since the balances in a poem are sequential rather than causal,
                and so can only be momentarily achieved, the poem's pros- ody must not offer the
                slightest resistance to reaching them . . . the prosodic resonance is all outward
                and discontinuous since what there is of it in itself is wholly implicit in the
                momentary balances between detail and design." </notes>
