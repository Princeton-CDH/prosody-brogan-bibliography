            <notes> With his customary cogency Beloof identifies seven prosodic modes in Cummings'
                work: stress verse, free verse, pictograms, syllabic verse, oral verse in visual
                form, dramatic free verse, and foot verse. The typographical poetry is found to be
                both oral and visual. Three periods in Cummings' prosodic development are
                postulated. The useful Appendix III classifies the poetry by prosodic type. </notes>

            <notes> Since "the general shape of his stanzas is Greek, the precise dimensions
                Hebrew," Herbert set for himself in the construction of the poem the problem of
                synthesizing his Hellenic and Hebraic sources and their traditions. </notes>

                rediscovery of the Greek Anthology at the end of the Middle Ages resulted in, among
                other things, a considerable number of imitations of pattern poems- -in England, in
                the sixteenth century, by Stephen Hawes, Richard Wills, and Puttenham, and on the
                continent, by Scalinger, Jean Crispin, and Joannes Pierius Valerianus. N.B.:
                Puttenham's mistaken attribution of the egg form to Anacreon proves he had not seen

            <notes> Having its roots in Elizabethan rhetorical patterning and Herbert's "Easter
                Wings," concrete poetry is still a young and playfully inventive art; it will have
                to become "visual not merely graphic," absorbing the dimension of space into a set
                of rational and functional principles of meaning, as traditional poetry has done.
                Three such principles are vertical-horizontal, axial, and circular. Many examples.

            <notes> Random sampling of such a correlation in a large number of poets produces an
                average: 95% in non-shaped poetry vs. 68% in shaped poetry. Conclusion: "when the
                poet becomes preoccupied with the visual image of the poem upon the page, the
                correlation between line and syntax is substantially lower than when the visual
                shape of the poem on the page is dictated by nonvisual criteria, i.e. by the number
                of syllables in the line, by phrasal units, by notions of rhythm analogous to
                "isochronous units," etc. </notes>

            <notes> If prosody comprises the "total rhythmic form" of a poem then everything which
                affects that form is by definition prosodic, including white space, lineation,
                paragraphing, spatial deployment of lines, and--especially-- punctuation, since the
                pointing controls both the temporal positioning and pacing of elements and also the
                sense. "To alter the poem's punctuation is to alter the poem's prosody, and, hence,
                its meaning," as can be shown by constructing twin dummy models of poems which
                differ only in punctuation. </notes>

                245–87. There is melos, and then there is opsis. There is, as correlate to the
                reading of poems, the "reading" of the shape of poems (in the sense in which art
                critics talk about "reading" or "scanning" a painting) which is so crucial for our
                determinations of meter and genre. There is the long tradition of poems picturing
                things--the pattern poems of the Renaissance, the concrete poetry of our own
                century--but then again there is the central visuality of syllabic verse and free
                verse, the importance of which far surpasses mere picturing by form in its deep
                access to the structure and nature--both quidditas and haecceitas--of the poem.

                was known to him only by word of mouth (from his trip to Italy?), and he seems to
                have relied mainly on the Occidental geometrical tradition. </notes>

            <notes> Identifies three characteristics of concrete poetry: foregrounding of spatial
                ordering, "reduction of language," and "functional repetition"; distinguishes three
                varieties of concrete poetry: poems retaining elements of traditional prosody, poems
                relying on sound for their "controlling structure," and poems employing space
                exclusively. Concludes that concrete poetry is open to analysis and interpretation.

            <notes> An adequate understanding of the possibilities inherent in this verseform rests
                on an adequate typology of the basic modes of visual organization, or a "visual
                syntax." Marcus postulates four types of relationships as syntactic constituents:
                figure-field, depth, structure, and movement; these four types are illustrated by
                fifty- seven subtypes with examples on pp. 356–60. This is the most valuable
                treatment of the subject yet produced. </notes>

            <notes> Though George Puttenham (E614) apparently had the last word on strictly
                geometrical form in poetry, Ranta identifies two forms in modern poetry--a "rising"
                and a "diminishing" design--which may be combined into a third, composite form, and
                which also operate both visually and aurally--spatially and temporally. These
                designs are conventional strategies of structure, not particularly connected to
                Concretism; they entail adding, repeating, or deleting lines from stanzas. And
                naturally the structural principle is displaced into imagery as well. The psychology
                of perception offers corroboration. Turgid beyond endurance, this essay is too long
                by half. </notes>

                nature, detaching themselves from the usual code if not establishing an entirely new
                code, and representing the simplest (most fundamental) conceptual categories by the
                strategy of spatialization. The two poems exemplify two entirely different "modes of

            <notes> Demonstration through numerous examples of the centrality of the principle of
                reduction in concrete poetry; since a concrete poem is "a structure which explores
                elements of language itself rather than one which uses language to explore something
                else. . . . the real concrete text only represents itself and is identical with what
                it shows." Jakobson's notion of equivalence and Levin's notion of coupling are also
                turned to use. </notes>
