            <notes> Uses the distribution-analysis methods of Charles C. Fries. Chapters on "The

                Phonological Context," and "The Special Effects of Unus- ual Syntax." Takes the
                written form of the poem as secondary to the oral form, and insists that
                interpretation must rest on the possibilities allowed by the phonological facts. The
                emphasis throughout is on theory and methodology, not on Eliot. </notes>

            <notes> A ranging review of the work of structural and transformational linguists
                (Trager &amp; Smith, Chomsky, et al.) on poetry with reference to the implica- tions
                for oral performance. Cannon, disappointed at the impact of the former school on
                American criticism in general, notes three shortcomings of the Structural treatment
                of poetry: (1) fragments rather than whole texts are taped and analyzed; (2)
                intentional ambiguities in the poem-in-print must be re- solved in performance; and
                (3) no one reading of a poem can supersede all the rest as authoritative or perfect.
                Still, he encourages familiarity with transcrip- tion and a linguistic understanding
                of poetic grammar. </notes>

            <notes> The entire section of eight essays on "Oral Poetry" is important; Corman dis-
                cusses the rhythms and meters of oral compositions, taking the "breath-unit" as the
                crucial element, each breath-unit being composed of various feet. "It is ac- cent
                that creates the basic rhythm and quantity (timing and sound-values) that creates
                the melodic line; but both must cohere in a true poem. Accent is the dance; quantity
                is the song." </notes>

            <notes> On the premise that the rhythm (meter) can only be determined correctly by
                marking the stresses heard in an oral interpretation, the author collected thirty
                such transcriptions of three poems, concluding from them (in spite of himself) that
                Jeffers' metric is not stress verse or free verse but "iambic-anapestic duple
                meter." </notes>

            <notes> Finnegan is the single most valuable source available on the social manifesta-
                tions of performed poetry. And though the scope of the book--its forte--is immense,
                providing for the first time a genuinely global perspective on the subject,
                nevertheless her judgment on each of the various specific problems in the theory is
                remarkably well-informed. See section 4.2 on "Prosodic Sys- tems," pp. 90–102, for

                developing brilliantly a concept of "homorganic alliteration" and also an analogy of

            <notes> It is interesting to contemplate its denigration as a primary category through-
                out the history of Western aesthetics, particularly since performance entails
                interpretation in music, poetry, drama, and dance, and perhaps also in paint- ing,

                315–21. An early study of what we would now term "breath-groups." The great rhythmic
                activities of the body are the breath and the heartbeat, four of the latter for each
                of the former. Reading octosyllabic verse, one takes about 20 breaths per minute to
                read about 20 lines per minute, thus making, by equiva- lence of the breath and
                line, such verse very easy to read. Iambic pentameter verse goes more slowly, since
                longer, and is thereby more fatiguing, but cae- suras are available as
                compensations. Ballad meters are hemistichic and easy; the duodecasyllabic line is
                rarely used because it is too long for one breath but too short for two. Finally, as
                line corresponds to breath, so accent may corre- spond to pulse--four pulses to the
                breath equal four stresses to the octosyllable. Certainly it is true that in the
                oral delivery of verse one must accomo- date the phrasal contours to one's breath;
                the question is whether such biologi- cal rhythms were the primal origins of meter.

                Glenview, Illinois: Scott, Foresman, 1966. pp. 344–51. At the outset, Levin cites
                Seymour Chatman from the 1956 Kenyon Review symposium (E712) as a examplar of the
                new interest by structural linguists in metrics. These linguists, armed with the
                Trager-Smith inventory of supraseg- mentals, believe that the meter was to be
                discovered by reading the poem aloud, and Chatman himself insists that ambiguity
                exists only on paper and is instantly resolved in oral performance. Levin's response
                is to distinguish lexical ambiguity (which no performance will disambiguate) from
                syntactic ambiguity (which is resolved in reading). Thereafter, he can only plead
                that ambiguity is an intentional device of intensification in poetry, and that
                insofar as oral per- formance reduces ambiguity, it performs "a real disservice to
                the poem." Am- biguity is preserved in "visual performance . . . a silent reading."

                poem. Cf. Loesch (I39). </notes>

                commitments or conclusions about the authority of the text, performance, or
                expectation for determining scansion save one: the reader must try to identify the
                prosodic pattern intended by the author, since that is by implication the best one
                the author could conceive. </notes>

            <notes> Part of a symposium. Acutely aware of the difficult problem of poetic ontol- ogy
                which underlies problems in both prosody and oral interpretation, Loesch charts some
                eminently tough-minded and pragmatic courses toward a solution. The indispensable
                core of such a solution is an adequate description of the poem both as text and as
                performance. Such adequacy we do not have at present; hence Loesch sets about to
                review all the important linguistic work done since Trager and Smith (D32) on
                phonology and metrics, showing clearly the nature of what has been accomplished, and
                also what has been ignored or slighted. Her grasp of the larger architecture of the
                theory is synoptic and firm. Sample phonetic transcription (i.e. a complete text) of
                "In My Craft or Sullen Art" at the end. </notes>

                (1965): 258–67.</bib>
            <notes> A very important counterargument to the structural metrists' claim (see I35)
                that in the performance of poetry all semantic ambiguities created by alterna- tive
                intonational patterns for a line must be resolved ("disambiguated") by the performer
                (since he can only utter the line one way one time). Loesch shows that "it is
                rarely, if ever, the case that only disambiguating intonations are avail- able. A
                non-disambiguating intonation is always available as well." This seems plain sense:
                unless we had heard ambiguous statements uttered, in the past, how would we know
                they existed? </notes>

            <notes> A first chapter treats prosody in a surprisingly sure-handed manner; thereafter,
                eight chapters explore the "speaking" of various genres of poetry. Altogether the
                book is considerably more intelligently written than one expects, and it altogether
                avoids the bombast, cant, and vacuity of most works on "oral inter- pretation."

            <notes> Winters with his odd blunt way insists on the distinction between meter and
                rhythm, arguing that therefore "adequate audible reading will be reading in which
                the rhythm of the poem is rendered intact," formally, the reader inton- ing the
                words in a style very close to chant. Illustrations of rhythmic varieties of the
                iambic pentameter, analyses, and general animadversions follow. Win- ters recognizes
